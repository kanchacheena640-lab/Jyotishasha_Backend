2. Purpose of Travel: Indicate whether the chart shows higher possibility for education, career, settlement, or spiritual reasons abroad.  
3. Timing of Travel: Likely phases when travel opportunities are strong, along with possible delays.  
4. Settlement Outlook: Whether the native is more likely to travel temporarily or settle long term in a foreign land.  
5. Challenges: Potential hurdles such as visa issues, family resistance, or adjustment difficulties.  
6. Dasha and Transit Impact: How the current Mahadasha and ongoing transits influence foreign travel possibilities.  
7. Remedies: Practical and positive remedies only (mantras, discipline, charity, cultural adaptability). Avoid superstition.  
8. Gemstone Suggestion: Suggest only one most suitable gemstone based on the chart (e.g., Yellow Sapphire for Jupiter, Pearl for Moon, Gomed for Rahu, etc.) and briefly explain its benefit.  
9. Conclusion: End with a warm, uplifting message that inspires confidence and clarity about the native’s travel and settlement prospects.
