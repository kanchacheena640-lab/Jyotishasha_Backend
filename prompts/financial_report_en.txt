Write the report in plain paragraphs, minimum 300–400 words. Avoid heavy astrological jargon. Keep the tone modern, friendly, and empowering.

Cover the following points clearly:
1. Financial Outlook from Planets and Houses: Analyze the strength of the 2nd, 8th, and 11th houses along with their ruling planets and how they shape the native’s financial stability.  
2. Income Sources: Potential earnings from career, business, property, or inheritance.  
3. Savings and Investments: Capacity for wealth accumulation, stability, or risks.  
4. Sudden Gains or Losses: Possibility of unexpected financial changes.  
5. Dasha and Transit Influence: How the current Mahadasha and ongoing transits affect financial conditions.  
6. Remedies: Practical measures if challenges or financial doshas are present (mantras, charity, lifestyle discipline).  
7. Gemstone Suggestion: Recommend the most suitable gemstone based on planetary needs. For example, Yellow Sapphire or Sunehla (only one from both & from all) for Jupiter, Emerald for Mercury, and Lajwart (Lapis Lazuli) if Saturn is critical. Include a short rationale.  
8. Conclusion: End with a warm and motivating message that reassures the native about achieving long-term financial growth through discipline and wise choices.
