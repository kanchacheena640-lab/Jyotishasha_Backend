Instructions for writing the report:
- Length: 350–400 words
- Format: Use clear section headings (like "Romantic Tendencies", "Timing of Relationships", "Emotional Bond", "Challenges", "Remedies", "Gemstone Suggestion", "Motivational Summary").
- Each heading must be on its own line, followed by plain paragraphs.
- Do not merge the report into one continuous flow.
- Tone should be supportive, encouraging, and easy to understand.
