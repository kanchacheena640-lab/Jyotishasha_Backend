Write a detailed, personalized Shani Sade-Sati report in simple, conversational English. Follow this structure exactly:

Example (for reference):
“During your Pratham phase of Sade-Sati, Saturn’s influence may bring discipline that guides your career. Though financial stability might feel shaky, there’s a steady inner growth. Your health may need mindful attention, especially routine and rest. The current Mahadasha supports Saturn’s lessons by encouraging patience. Remedies like daily mantra chanting and modest charity help ground you. Lapis Lazuli (Lajwart) could be a supportive stone, strengthening Saturn’s focus. Overall, while challenges exist, this period offers spiritual maturity.”

Now write your report (at least 350–400 words), covering:
1. Current Sade-Sati phase (Pratham, Madhya, Antya) and its general meaning.
2. Impact on career, finances, health, relationships, and emotions.
3. Opportunities and strengths Saturn brings.
4. Challenges and lessons.
5. Mahadasha’s influence on this phase.
6. Practical remedies—mantras, discipline, charity, lifestyle.
7. Gemstone suggestion—use Lajwart if Saturn needs strengthening; otherwise choose another relevant gemstone with a brief rationale.
8. A warm, uplifting conclusion to empower the native.

Use conversational tone, no jargon, no bullet points, just plain paragraphs.
