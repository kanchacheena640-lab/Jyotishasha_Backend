  "title": "Mars Transit in First House: Assertive Identity, Physical Drive, and Reactive Energy",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mars transiting the first house energizes the self, body, and personal direction. Physical vitality rises, but emotional sensitivity makes reactions sharper and quicker. You may feel compelled to act, assert opinions, and push personal agendas more forcefully than usual. Confidence increases, yet impatience and irritability can surface if energy is unmanaged. When directed with discipline, this transit supports courage, decisive action, and rebuilding self-belief through purposeful movement.",
