  "title": "Mars Transit in Second House: Assertive Speech, Financial Drive, and Value Conflicts",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mars transiting the second house activates finances, speech, and personal values. The urge to earn, secure resources, and protect possessions becomes strong. Speech turns direct and forceful, sometimes sharp, requiring conscious restraint. Financial decisions are driven by action and urgency, increasing both earning potential and risk of impulsive spending. When energy is channelled with discipline, this transit strengthens financial initiative, value clarity, and the courage to stand by one’s principles.",
