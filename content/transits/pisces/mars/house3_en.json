  "title": "Mars Transit in Third House: Courageous Communication, Initiative, and Assertive Efforts",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mars transiting the third house energizes communication, courage, and personal initiative. Mental drive sharpens, making you more outspoken, action-oriented, and willing to take risks. Efforts toward skills, writing, sales, or media intensify, but impatience in conversations can create friction. Relationships with siblings or close peers may feel competitive. When energy is channelled constructively, this transit supports bold decision-making, skill development, and the confidence to act on ideas.",
