  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mars transiting the ninth house energizes beliefs, higher learning, and long-distance pursuits. Convictions become action-oriented, pushing you to defend ideals and pursue purpose with courage. Travel, higher studies, publishing, or mentorship may accelerate, though impatience with differing views can spark debates. Authority figures and mentors may be challenged if principles clash. When zeal is guided by wisdom, this transit supports fearless exploration, principled leadership, and progress aligned with a clear moral compass.",
