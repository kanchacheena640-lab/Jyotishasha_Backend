  "title": "Mars Transit in Fourth House: Domestic Restlessness, Emotional Heat, and Protective Instincts",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mars transiting the fourth house stirs strong emotions at home and within the inner psyche. The urge to take charge of domestic matters rises, but impatience can create tension with family members. Energy turns toward property, repairs, or relocation, while emotional security feels challenged. When anger is managed and actions are grounded, this transit supports decisive domestic improvements, boundary setting, and rebuilding inner stability through purposeful effort.",
