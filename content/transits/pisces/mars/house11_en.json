  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mars transiting the eleventh house activates ambition, goal pursuit, and social networks. Aspirations become urgent and action-driven, pushing you to chase gains through bold initiatives. Group dynamics may turn competitive, requiring strategic cooperation rather than dominance. Income linked to projects or teams can rise with effort, though impatience may strain alliances. When energy is channelled toward shared objectives, this transit supports goal achievement, influential networking, and gains earned through decisive action.",
