  "title": "Mars Transit in Seventh House: Assertive Partnerships, Confrontation, and Passion",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mars transiting the seventh house intensifies one-to-one relationships, partnerships, and public dealings. Interactions become direct and charged; passion rises but so can confrontation. You may assert needs more forcefully in marriage or business ties, prompting power struggles if balance is missing. Negotiations require patience and fairness. When assertiveness is paired with respect, this transit fuels productive collaboration, decisive agreements, and relationships strengthened through honest, courageous dialogue.",
