  "title": "Mars Transit in Twelfth House: Hidden Drive, Energy Drain, and Strategic Withdrawal",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mars transiting the twelfth house turns energy inward, emphasizing behind-the-scenes effort, solitude, and controlled release of force. Motivation may feel uneven, with phases of exhaustion followed by bursts of focused action. Expenses can rise due to travel, health, or private projects. Anger expressed unconsciously can disrupt sleep or peace if not managed. When directed with discipline, this transit supports strategic retreats, confidential work, spiritual discipline, and victories achieved quietly rather than publicly.",
