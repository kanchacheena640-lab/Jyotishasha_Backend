  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Venus transiting the fifth house enhances romance, creativity, and joyful self-expression. This phase supports love affairs, artistic pursuits, and pleasure derived from learning and hobbies. Emotional warmth flows easily, making relationships lighter and more affectionate. Creative talents find appreciation, and matters related to children feel harmonious. However, indulgence or emotional idealism can cloud judgment.
