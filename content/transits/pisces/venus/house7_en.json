  "title": "Venus Transit in the Seventh House: Relationships, Harmony, and Mutual Growth",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Venus transiting the seventh house strengthens relationships, partnerships, and social harmony. This phase supports romantic connections, marriage matters, and cooperative business dealings. Mutual understanding grows through empathy and balanced communication. Public interactions become smoother, enhancing reputation and client relations. However, excessive compromise or idealizing partners can weaken boundaries. When equality and clarity guide commitments, this transit deepens trust, attraction, and long-term relational stability.",
