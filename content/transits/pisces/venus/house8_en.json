  "title": "Venus Transit in the Eighth House: Intimacy, Transformation, and Shared Values",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Venus transiting the eighth house deepens intimacy, emotional bonds, and transformative experiences. This phase supports healing within close relationships, refinement in shared finances, and a subtler understanding of desires. Attraction becomes intense yet private, encouraging trust and vulnerability. Joint resources benefit from transparency and fairness. However, secrecy, dependency, or indulgent attachments can create imbalance. When honesty and emotional maturity guide actions, this transit strengthens intimacy, resilience, and shared growth.",
