  "title": "Venus Transit in the Tenth House: Reputation, Career Grace, and Public Appeal",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Venus transiting the tenth house enhances public image, professional relationships, and career grace. This phase supports recognition through diplomacy, creativity, and people-oriented skills. Work environments become more pleasant, and appreciation comes from refined conduct rather than force. Artistic, design, advisory, or client-facing roles benefit strongly. However, comfort-seeking or avoiding responsibility can slow progress. When elegance aligns with accountability, this transit strengthens reputation, career harmony, and sustainable success.",
