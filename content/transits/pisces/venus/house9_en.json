  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Venus transiting the ninth house refines values, belief systems, and higher learning. This phase supports pleasant interactions with mentors, interest in philosophy, and growth through ethical choices. Travel, education, and cultural exposure feel enriching and balanced. Relationships benefit from shared ideals and mutual respect. However, idealizing beliefs or avoiding practical grounding can limit outcomes.
