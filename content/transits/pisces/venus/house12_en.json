  "title": "Venus Transit in the Twelfth House: Compassion, Release, and Subtle Fulfillment",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Venus transiting the twelfth house emphasizes compassion, release, and subtle fulfillment. This phase supports quiet affection, charitable acts, and inner healing through love without expectation. Artistic inspiration flows in solitude, and relationships may express themselves privately. Expenses can rise for comfort, travel, or meaningful causes, requiring mindful budgeting. Escapism or secret attachments can weaken balance. When boundaries guide generosity, this transit nurtures peace, emotional closure, and refined inner contentment.",
