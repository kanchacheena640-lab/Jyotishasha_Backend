  "title": "Moon Transit in Ninth House: Emotional Faith, Belief Shifts, and Inner Guidance",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Moon transiting the ninth house turns emotions toward beliefs, higher meaning, and moral guidance. Faith, philosophy, and personal ethics feel emotionally charged, influencing decisions and outlook. Guidance from teachers, mentors, or father figures may be sought for reassurance. Long journeys, spiritual learning, or studies bring emotional fulfillment. When belief is tempered with openness, this transit strengthens intuitive wisdom, emotional faith, and a compassionate worldview aligned with inner truth.",
