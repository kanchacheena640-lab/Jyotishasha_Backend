  "title": "Moon Transit in Twelfth House: Emotional Release, Solitude, and Subconscious Healing",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Moon transiting the twelfth house draws emotions inward, heightening sensitivity, imagination, and the need for solitude. Emotional energy seeks rest, reflection, and quiet processing rather than outward expression. Sleep patterns, dreams, and subconscious memories become more active. Expenses may rise for healing, charity, or meaningful retreats. When emotions are honored through rest and compassionate release, this transit supports deep healing, intuitive clarity, and gentle closure of emotional cycles.",
