  "title": "Moon Transit in First House: Emotional Sensitivity, Self-Awareness, and Inner Fluidity",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Moon transiting the first house heightens emotional sensitivity, intuition, and self-awareness. You may feel more receptive to your surroundings and others’ moods, making emotions central to decision-making. Personal needs, comfort, and mental well-being take priority. This transit enhances empathy and imagination but can also bring mood fluctuations. When emotional awareness is balanced with grounding, the Moon here nurtures authenticity, emotional intelligence, and a deeper connection with the self.",
