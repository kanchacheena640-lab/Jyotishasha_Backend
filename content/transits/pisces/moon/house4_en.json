  "title": "Moon Transit in Fourth House: Emotional Roots, Home Comfort, and Inner Peace",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Moon transiting the fourth house heightens emotional attachment to home, family, and inner security. Comfort, privacy, and peace of mind become priorities, and moods are strongly influenced by the domestic environment. Matters related to residence, property, or the mother figure come into focus. Emotional nourishment through familiar spaces is essential. When inner calm is cultivated and boundaries are respected, this transit supports healing, emotional stability, and a deep sense of belonging.",
