  "title": "Moon Transit in Sixth House: Emotional Discipline, Service, and Health Awareness",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Moon transiting the sixth house brings emotions into daily work, service, and health routines. You may feel mentally occupied with responsibilities, deadlines, and problem-solving. Emotional responses to stress, criticism, or competition can fluctuate, making self-care essential. Health becomes sensitive to mood and habits, highlighting the need for regular routines. When emotions are organized through discipline and service, this transit strengthens resilience, practical intelligence, and the ability to manage challenges calmly.",
