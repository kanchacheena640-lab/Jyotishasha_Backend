  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the Fifth House: Intelligence, Creativity, and Purposeful Growth",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit through the fifth house enhances intelligence, creativity, and purposeful expression. This phase supports learning, teaching, and refined decision-making driven by wisdom rather than impulse. Creative talents mature, and guidance-oriented roles gain recognition. Matters related to children, education, and self-expression move toward stability. However, overconfidence in judgment or speculative risks can reduce gains. When discipline balances inspiration, this transit strengthens intellect, moral clarity, and long-term creative fulfillment.",
