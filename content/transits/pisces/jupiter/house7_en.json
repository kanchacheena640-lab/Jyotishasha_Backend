This period supports committed relationships, ethical alliances, and constructive negotiations. Wisdom guides interactions with partners, clients, and the public, improving trust and cooperation. Long-term agreements benefit from clarity and fairness. However, idealizing others or avoiding necessary boundaries can weaken outcomes.
