  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit through the eighth house activates transformation, inner growth, and hidden knowledge. This phase supports deep emotional healing, research, and understanding of life’s complexities. Sudden changes encourage wisdom, resilience, and trust in long-term processes. Matters related to shared resources, inheritance, or joint finances require ethical handling. However, avoidance of reality or blind optimism can create instability. When patience and awareness guide actions, this transit strengthens inner power and spiritual maturity.",
