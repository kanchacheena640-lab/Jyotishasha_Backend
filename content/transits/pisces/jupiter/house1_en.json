  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Jupiter transiting the first house marks a phase of personal expansion, confidence, and renewed faith in self. Outlook becomes optimistic, decisions are guided by ethics, and presence feels supportive to others. Health and vitality generally improve with balanced habits. Opportunities arise through learning, teaching, and guidance roles. Overconfidence or excess can dilute gains if unchecked. When growth is paired with humility and consistency, this transit strengthens identity, wisdom, and long-term direction.",
