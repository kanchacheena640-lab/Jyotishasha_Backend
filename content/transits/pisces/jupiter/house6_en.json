  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit through the sixth house shifts focus toward service, discipline, and practical problem-solving. This phase supports steady improvement in work routines, health awareness, and conflict resolution through wisdom rather than force. Challenges turn into learning opportunities when handled ethically. Jupiter encourages balanced habits, humility, and constructive effort. However, avoidance of routine or moral superiority can create resistance. With consistency and responsibility, this transit strengthens resilience, competence, and long-term stability.",
