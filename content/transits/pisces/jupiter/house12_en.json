  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the Twelfth House: Release, Spiritual Growth, and Inner Expansion",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit through the twelfth house emphasizes release, spiritual growth, and inner expansion. This phase supports introspection, compassion, and service without expectation. Expenses rise for meaningful causes, learning, or healing. Solitude brings clarity, and faith deepens through surrender. However, escapism or unmanaged spending can weaken stability. When boundaries guide generosity, this transit strengthens wisdom, closure of old cycles, and peaceful alignment with higher purpose.",
