  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the Second House: Wealth, Speech, and Value Stability",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit through the second house expands themes of wealth, speech, and family values. This phase supports steady financial growth, ethical income, and long-term security rather than quick gains. Your speech carries wisdom and authority, improving respect within family and professional circles. Financial decisions become value-driven and practical. However, overconfidence or excessive generosity can weaken gains. When discipline and clarity guide actions, this transit strengthens material foundations and inner self-worth.",
