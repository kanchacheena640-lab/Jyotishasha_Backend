  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the Fourth House: Emotional Security, Home, and Inner Stability",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit through the fourth house enhances emotional security, domestic harmony, and inner balance. This period supports stability in home matters, property decisions, and relationships with mother or caretakers. Wisdom guides choices related to residence, education, and long-term comfort. A calm inner state improves decision-making and productivity. However, excessive attachment or comfort-seeking can slow progress. When gratitude and discipline are maintained, this transit strengthens roots while nurturing peace and emotional resilience.",
