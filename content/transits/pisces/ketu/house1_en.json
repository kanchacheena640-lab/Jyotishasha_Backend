  "title": "Ketu Transit in the First House: Identity Detachment, Inner Redefinition, and Spiritual Realignment",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the first house dissolves attachment to identity, appearance, and ego-driven validation. A phase of introspection begins, often bringing detachment from old self-images and personal roles. Confidence may feel muted, yet inner awareness deepens significantly. Health and vitality require mindful routines, as energy can fluctuate. This transit favors spiritual practices, self-inquiry, and simplification. When resistance is released, Ketu supports profound self-realignment, clarity beyond labels, and authentic inner strength.",
