  "title": "Ketu Transit in the Eighth House: Deep Detachment, Karmic Release, and Inner Transformation",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the eighth house intensifies detachment from fear, control, and dependency on shared resources. Sudden inner shifts prompt release of past attachments and unresolved karmic patterns. Interest in occult knowledge, healing, or deep research grows, while emotional vulnerability requires conscious grounding. Joint finances and inheritances demand clarity and caution. This transit favors surrender, introspection, and healing. When resistance is dropped, Ketu enables profound transformation, inner resilience, and liberation from subconscious burdens.",
