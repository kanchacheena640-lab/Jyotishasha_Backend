  "title": "Ketu Transit in the Ninth House: Disengagement from Dogma, Inner Faith, and Experiential Wisdom",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the ninth house weakens attachment to rigid belief systems, formal religion, and external authority. Faith turns inward, favoring lived experience over doctrine. Distance from mentors or father figures may occur, prompting independent moral reasoning. Long-distance travel or higher studies become selective and purpose-driven. This transit supports spiritual inquiry without labels. When humility and discernment guide learning, Ketu cultivates authentic wisdom, ethical clarity, and a personal philosophy rooted in direct insight.",
