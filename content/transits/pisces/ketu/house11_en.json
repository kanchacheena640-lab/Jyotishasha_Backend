  "title": "Ketu Transit in the Eleventh House: Detachment from Gains, Selective Networks, and Purposeful Aspirations",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the eleventh house reduces attachment to material gains, social popularity, and outcome-driven goals. Desire for large networks fades, replaced by selective, purpose-aligned associations. Income may feel irregular, urging clarity between needs and excess. Long-term goals are re-evaluated for meaning rather than scale. This transit favors quiet contribution over recognition. When expectations are released and service guides intent, Ketu aligns aspirations with inner truth and sustainable fulfillment.",
