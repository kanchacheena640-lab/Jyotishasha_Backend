  "title": "Ketu Transit in the Twelfth House: Deep Release, Spiritual Withdrawal, and Subconscious Purification",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the twelfth house intensifies withdrawal from material attachments, isolation, and the need for external validation. Expenses may reduce naturally as detachment grows, yet hidden drains require awareness. Sleep patterns, dreams, and subconscious processes become highly active, calling for grounding practices. This transit strongly favors meditation, solitude, and spiritual disciplines. When escapism is avoided and awareness is sustained, Ketu supports profound inner purification, karmic release, and liberation from unconscious patterns.",
