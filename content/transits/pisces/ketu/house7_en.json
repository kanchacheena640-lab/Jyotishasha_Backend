  "title": "Ketu Transit in the Seventh House: Relationship Detachment, Karmic Bonds, and Clarity in Partnerships",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the seventh house brings detachment from dependency within relationships and partnerships. Emotional expectations reduce, prompting a reassessment of commitment, balance, and mutual purpose. Marital or business bonds may feel karmic, distant, or neutral, demanding clarity rather than intensity. Partnerships function best with defined roles and minimal projection. This transit favors conscious boundaries and self-awareness. When attachment is released, Ketu restores equilibrium, mature relating, and partnerships aligned with truth.",
