  "title": "Ketu Transit in the Third House: Reduced Assertion, Skill Refinement, and Inner Courage",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the third house reduces outward assertiveness while redirecting effort toward inner discipline and refined skills. Motivation to compete or self-promote declines, yet focus on solitary learning, writing, or technical abilities strengthens. Relationships with siblings may feel distant or neutral. Short travels become purposeful rather than frequent. This transit favors behind-the-scenes effort and mastery without noise. When persistence replaces impatience, Ketu builds quiet courage, precision, and self-reliant competence.",
