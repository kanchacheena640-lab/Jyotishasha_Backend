  "title": "Ketu Transit in the Tenth House: Detachment from Status, Purpose Redefined, and Quiet Authority",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the tenth house reduces attachment to titles, public validation, and conventional career ambition. Professional direction may feel unclear, pushing a reassessment of purpose over prestige. Authority is expressed quietly, often behind the scenes, while visible recognition feels less important. Sudden disengagement from roles or shifts in responsibility are possible. When work aligns with inner values and service, this transit builds integrity, calm leadership, and a career path rooted in meaning rather than image.",
