  "title": "Ketu Transit in the Fifth House: Creative Detachment, Karmic Learning, and Inner Intelligence",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the fifth house brings detachment from validation through creativity, romance, and recognition. Creative expression becomes inward-focused, favoring depth over display. Romantic interests may feel distant or karmic, urging emotional maturity. Matters related to children, speculation, or risk require patience and neutrality. Intellectual pursuits shift toward research and contemplation rather than competition. When expectations are released, this transit sharpens intuition, refines wisdom, and supports learning driven by inner truth.",
