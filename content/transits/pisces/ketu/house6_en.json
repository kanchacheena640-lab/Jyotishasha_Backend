  "title": "Ketu Transit in the Sixth House: Detached Service, Karmic Cleansing, and Health Discipline",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the sixth house promotes detached service, karmic cleanup, and a non-reactive approach to conflicts. Interest in routine work or competition reduces, yet efficiency improves when duties are handled quietly. Health requires disciplined habits, as subtle or chronic issues may surface for resolution. Enemies lose impact when ignored, but negligence can create setbacks. When service is rendered without ego and routines are consistent, this transit purifies karma, sharpens discernment, and restores balance.",
