  "title": "Ketu Transit in the Fourth House: Emotional Detachment, Inner Security, and Redefining Home",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the fourth house brings emotional detachment from home, comforts, and familiar attachments. A sense of restlessness within the domestic sphere may arise, even when external stability exists. Emotional fulfillment shifts inward, reducing dependence on family validation. Property or relocation matters require clarity and patience. This transit favors inner anchoring through mindfulness and simplicity. When inner security is cultivated, Ketu helps redefine home as a state of awareness rather than a physical place.",
