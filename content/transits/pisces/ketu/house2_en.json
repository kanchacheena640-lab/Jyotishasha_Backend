  "title": "Ketu Transit in the Second House: Detachment from Possessions, Speech Refinement, and Value Reassessment",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Ketu transiting the second house brings detachment from material accumulation and a reassessment of personal values. Interest in saving or hoarding reduces, while simplicity gains importance. Speech becomes reserved, precise, or unusually blunt, requiring mindful communication. Family dynamics may feel distant, urging emotional neutrality. Financial flow can feel irregular, favoring minimalism over expansion. When awareness guides choices, this transit refines priorities, purifies speech, and aligns resources with inner truth.",
