  "title": "Sun Transit in Third House: Courage, Communication, and Self-Initiated Action",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Sun transiting the third house energizes courage, communication, and personal initiative. Confidence grows in expressing ideas, taking bold steps, and asserting opinions. Efforts toward writing, media, marketing, or skill-based work gain momentum. Relationships with siblings and peers come into focus, sometimes requiring firm boundaries. Short travels and hands-on learning increase. When confidence is paired with listening, this transit sharpens influence, strengthens willpower, and turns ideas into decisive action.",
