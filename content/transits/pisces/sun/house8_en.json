  "title": "Sun Transit in Eighth House: Transformation, Power Shifts, and Inner Resilience",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Sun transiting the eighth house triggers deep transformation, confronting fears, control issues, and shared-resource dynamics. Attention turns inward toward psychological strength, healing, and regeneration. Sudden changes around joint finances, inheritances, or emotional bonds may surface, requiring composure and transparency. Authority dynamics feel intense, pushing you to relinquish rigid control. When ego yields to awareness, this transit strengthens resilience, sharpens insight, and enables renewal through conscious surrender.",
