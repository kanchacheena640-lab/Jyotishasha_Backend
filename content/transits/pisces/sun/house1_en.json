  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Sun transiting the first house brings a strong focus on identity, confidence, and self-expression. This period highlights personal authority, visibility, and the need to assert your presence. You may feel more decisive, driven, and aware of how others perceive you. Health, vitality, and personal discipline come into focus. While leadership qualities rise, ego sensitivity can also increase. When balanced with humility, this transit strengthens self-belief, clarity of direction, and purposeful action.",
