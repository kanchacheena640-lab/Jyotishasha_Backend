  "title": "Sun Transit in Ninth House: Dharma, Higher Vision, and Guiding Principles",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Sun transiting the ninth house illuminates beliefs, higher learning, and life direction. There is a strong urge to define personal philosophy, seek meaning, and stand by principles with confidence. Relationships with mentors, teachers, or father figures come into focus, sometimes requiring maturity and mutual respect. Long-distance travel, studies, or spiritual pursuits gain momentum when purpose-driven. When humility accompanies conviction, this transit strengthens dharma, ethical clarity, and a confident long-range vision.",
