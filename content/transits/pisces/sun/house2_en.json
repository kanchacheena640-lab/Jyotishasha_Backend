  "title": "Sun Transit in Second House: Voice, Values, and Financial Self-Worth",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Sun transiting the second house highlights speech, values, family responsibilities, and financial self-worth. Your voice carries authority, and there is a strong urge to express opinions with confidence. Attention turns to income stability, savings, and how resources reflect personal dignity. Family matters may require leadership or firm decisions. While financial focus sharpens, pride in speech can create friction if unchecked. When values guide choices, this transit strengthens self-respect, disciplined finances, and credible communication.",
