  "title": "Sun Transit in Seventh House: Relationship Authority, Visibility, and Partnership Balance",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Sun transiting the seventh house brings focus to partnerships, marriage, and public interactions. Relationships become more visible, and themes of authority, leadership, and ego surface within one-to-one bonds. You may take a dominant role or attract strong-willed partners. Business dealings and agreements require clarity and fairness. While confidence in dealing with others increases, balance is essential to avoid power struggles. When mutual respect guides actions, this transit strengthens mature partnerships and public credibility.",
