  "title": "Sun Transit in Twelfth House: Withdrawal, Inner Strength, and Conscious Release",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Sun transiting the twelfth house draws attention inward toward rest, solitude, and conscious release. External recognition matters less, while inner clarity and healing gain priority. Expenses may rise for meaningful causes, health, or spiritual pursuits. Sleep patterns, dreams, and subconscious themes intensify, requiring mindful routines. This transit supports closure of old chapters and compassionate service done quietly. When ego softens into awareness, the Sun here restores vitality through surrender, reflection, and purposeful withdrawal.",
