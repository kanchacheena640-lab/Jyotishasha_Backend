  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Sun transiting the eleventh house energizes goals, gains, and social influence. Ambitions become clearer, and efforts begin to attract recognition through networks, teams, or communities. You may step into leadership within groups and feel motivated to pursue long-term aspirations with confidence. Income opportunities can arise through visibility and alliances, though expectations should remain realistic. When ego is balanced with collaboration, this transit brings fulfillment, steady gains, and a stronger sense of purpose within collective spaces.",
