  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, the Sun transiting the fifth house amplifies creativity, self-expression, and the desire for recognition. Talents seek visibility, and confidence grows in artistic pursuits, education, and leadership roles. Romance becomes expressive and proud, while matters related to children and learning demand responsible guidance. Speculative interests may rise but require disciplined judgment. When ego is balanced with joy, this transit strengthens intelligence, originality, and the courage to shine authentically.",
