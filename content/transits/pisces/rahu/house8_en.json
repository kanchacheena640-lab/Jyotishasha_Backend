  "title": "Rahu Transit in the Eighth House: Obsession, Sudden Shifts, and Deep Transformation",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Rahu transiting the eighth house intensifies obsession, secrecy, and sudden life changes. Interest in hidden knowledge, psychology, and the unknown grows sharply. Joint finances, debts, or inheritances may fluctuate unexpectedly and require strict vigilance. Emotional extremes can surface, pushing inner fears to the surface for resolution. This transit rewards research, investigation, and strategic restraint. When awareness replaces control, Rahu enables profound transformation, resilience, and mastery over hidden vulnerabilities.",
