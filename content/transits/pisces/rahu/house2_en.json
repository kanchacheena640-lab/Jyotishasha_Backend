  "title": "Rahu Transit in the Second House: Desire for Wealth, Speech Shifts, and Value Reassessment",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Rahu transiting the second house intensifies focus on wealth, possessions, and personal values. The urge to increase income and display status rises, sometimes pushing unconventional financial choices. Speech becomes influential but can turn sharp or exaggerated if unchecked. Family dynamics may feel unsettled due to changing priorities. This transit rewards strategic thinking and ethical boundaries. When discipline guides ambition, Rahu helps modernize income sources, refine communication, and realign values for material growth.",
