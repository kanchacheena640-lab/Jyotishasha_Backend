  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Rahu transiting the ninth house challenges belief systems, ethics, and long-held philosophies. Attraction toward foreign cultures, unconventional teachings, and alternative paths intensifies. Faith may feel unsettled as curiosity pushes you to question traditions and authority figures. Long-distance travel, higher studies, or legal matters may take unexpected turns. This transit favors exploration and innovation, but confusion arises without discernment. When awareness guides learning, Rahu expands vision, global exposure, and independent wisdom.",
