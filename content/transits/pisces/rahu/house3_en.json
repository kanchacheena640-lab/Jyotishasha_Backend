  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Rahu transiting the third house amplifies communication, initiative, and the urge to take bold actions. Curiosity spikes, networking expands, and unconventional ideas gain momentum. Courage increases, yet impatience can trigger conflicts with siblings or peers. Short travels and skill-building bring opportunities if plans are structured. This transit favors media, sales, and technology when ethics guide ambition. With focus and discipline, Rahu sharpens strategy, influence, and competitive edge.",
