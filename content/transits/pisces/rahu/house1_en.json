  "title": "Rahu Transit in the First House: Identity Shift, Ambition, and Unconventional Drive",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Rahu transiting the first house triggers a strong shift in identity, self-image, and personal ambition. You may feel compelled to redefine yourself, seek recognition, and experiment with new roles or appearances. Confidence rises, but clarity can fluctuate, leading to impulsive choices if grounding is missing. This transit amplifies desires and visibility, making it vital to align actions with ethics. When awareness guides ambition, Rahu brings bold growth, innovation, and a powerful personal reset.",
