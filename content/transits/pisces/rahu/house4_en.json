  "title": "Rahu Transit in the Fourth House: Emotional Restlessness, Home Changes, and Inner Reconditioning",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Rahu transiting the fourth house creates emotional restlessness and a strong urge to change home, environment, or lifestyle. Inner peace may feel disturbed as material comfort competes with emotional security. Sudden decisions related to property, residence, or vehicles are possible and require caution. Family dynamics, especially with the mother, may feel unconventional or detached. When awareness guides choices, this transit helps modernize domestic life and rebuild inner stability on clearer foundations.",
