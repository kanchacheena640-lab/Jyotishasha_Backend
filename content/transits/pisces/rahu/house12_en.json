  "title": "Rahu Transit in the Twelfth House: Escapism, Foreign Pull, and Subconscious Awakening",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Rahu transiting the twelfth house heightens escapist tendencies, foreign connections, and subconscious activity. Expenses may rise suddenly, often toward travel, technology, or hidden commitments. Sleep patterns and mental peace can feel disturbed if boundaries are weak. This phase intensifies interest in spirituality, isolation, and behind-the-scenes work, yet illusions must be filtered carefully. When discipline anchors awareness, Rahu supports deep inner insight, foreign gains, and conscious release of limiting patterns.",
