  "title": "Rahu Transit in the Seventh House: Unconventional Partnerships, Attraction, and Relationship Tests",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Rahu transiting the seventh house brings intense focus on relationships, partnerships, and public dealings. Attraction toward unconventional or foreign partners increases, while expectations can become unrealistic. Business alliances may form suddenly but need clear terms to last. Emotional confusion or power imbalance is possible if boundaries are weak. This transit rewards transparency, self-awareness, and ethical conduct. When clarity guides choices, Rahu expands influence, negotiation skills, and dynamic partnerships.",
