  "title": "Saturn Transit in the Seventh House: Commitment, Boundaries, and Relationship Maturity",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Saturn transiting the seventh house tests partnerships, marriage, and professional alliances through responsibility and realism. Relationships demand patience, clear boundaries, and honest communication. Commitments become serious, sometimes delayed, but more durable when built on mutual effort. Business partnerships require defined roles and accountability. Loneliness or emotional distance can surface if expectations are unrealistic. When discipline replaces avoidance, this transit forges reliable bonds, equitable agreements, and long-term relational stability.",
