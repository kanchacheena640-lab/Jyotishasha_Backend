  "title": "Saturn Transit in the Eighth House: Transformation, Endurance, and Inner Strength",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Saturn transiting the eighth house brings deep transformation, endurance, and karmic cleansing. This phase tests emotional resilience through sudden changes, shared resources, and psychological depth. Matters related to joint finances, debts, or inheritances demand caution and transparency. Fear or resistance can intensify pressure, while acceptance builds strength. Healing progresses slowly but thoroughly through discipline and self-awareness. When patience replaces control, this transit forges inner stability, maturity, and lasting regenerative power.",
