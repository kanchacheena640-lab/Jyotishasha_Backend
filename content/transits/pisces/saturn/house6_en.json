  "title": "Saturn Transit in the Sixth House: Discipline in Work, Health, and Service",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Saturn transiting the sixth house emphasizes discipline in work routines, health management, and service-oriented responsibilities. This phase demands persistence in daily duties, problem-solving, and handling opposition with maturity. Workload may increase, but steady effort brings authority and competence. Health improves through structure and long-term habits rather than quick fixes. Conflicts resolve slowly through patience and fairness. Avoid burnout or rigidity. When consistency guides action, this transit builds resilience, efficiency, and practical strength.",
