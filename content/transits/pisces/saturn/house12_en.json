  "title": "Saturn Transit in the Twelfth House: Inner Discipline, Detachment, and Karmic Closure",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Saturn transiting the twelfth house emphasizes inner discipline, solitude, and karmic closure. Expenses, isolation, or hidden responsibilities may increase, demanding careful management and emotional maturity. This phase supports spiritual practice, research, and behind-the-scenes work when approached with structure. Escapism or avoidance can deepen stress, while acceptance brings clarity. Letting go of outdated patterns is essential. With patience and restraint, this transit strengthens inner stability, prepares the ground for renewal, and completes long karmic cycles.",
