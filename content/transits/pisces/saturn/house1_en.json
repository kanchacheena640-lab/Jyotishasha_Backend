  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Saturn transiting the first house marks a phase of personal restructuring, maturity, and self-discipline. This period reshapes identity through responsibility, patience, and realistic self-assessment. Confidence grows slowly but becomes stable and grounded. Physical vitality may feel tested, demanding structured routines and mindful health care. Others perceive you as serious and dependable. Resistance to effort or self-doubt can feel heavy. When perseverance replaces avoidance, this transit builds resilience, authority, and long-term personal strength.",
