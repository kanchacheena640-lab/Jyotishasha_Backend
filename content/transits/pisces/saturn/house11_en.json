  "title": "Saturn Transit in the Eleventh House: Structured Gains, Mature Networks, and Long-Term Goals",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Saturn transiting the eleventh house restructures gains, social circles, and long-term aspirations. Income grows slowly but steadily through disciplined effort and reliable networks. Friendships become selective, favoring mature and goal-aligned connections over casual ties. Organizational roles demand accountability and patience. Unrealistic expectations around profits or support may be tested. When persistence replaces haste, this transit builds sustainable gains, dependable alliances, and achievement of objectives through consistency and strategic planning.",
