  "title": "Saturn Transit in the Fourth House: Emotional Maturity, Stability, and Inner Security",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Saturn transiting the fourth house emphasizes emotional maturity, inner stability, and responsibility toward home and family. This phase restructures domestic foundations, demanding patience in property, residence, and family matters. Emotional comfort may feel limited, pushing you to build security through discipline rather than dependence. Responsibilities toward parents increase. Progress comes slowly but becomes lasting. Resistance to duty or emotional withdrawal can create heaviness. When commitment replaces avoidance, this transit builds resilient inner strength and dependable domestic stability.",
