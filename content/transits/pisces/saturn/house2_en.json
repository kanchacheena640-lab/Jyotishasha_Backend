  "title": "Saturn Transit in the Second House: Financial Discipline, Speech Control, and Value Consolidation",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Saturn transiting the second house brings financial discipline, serious thinking, and restructuring of personal values. Income grows slowly through sustained effort rather than quick gains. Speech becomes measured and practical, sometimes perceived as reserved. Family responsibilities increase, demanding maturity and long-term planning. Savings improve when expenses are controlled with realism. However, fear-driven conservatism or harsh speech can strain relationships. When patience guides decisions, this transit builds durable wealth, self-respect, and value-based stability.",
