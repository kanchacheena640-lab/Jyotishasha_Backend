  "title": "Saturn Transit in the Third House: Discipline in Effort, Communication, and Courage",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Saturn transiting the third house brings disciplined effort, serious communication, and measured courage. This phase demands consistency in skills, writing, and daily initiatives. Progress comes through sustained practice rather than quick wins. Relationships with siblings and peers require patience and clear boundaries. Short travels feel purposeful but duty-driven. Fear of expression or over-cautiousness can slow momentum. When perseverance replaces hesitation, this transit builds reliable skills, steady confidence, and long-term competence.",
