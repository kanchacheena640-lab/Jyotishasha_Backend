  "title": "Saturn Transit in the Ninth House: Belief Testing, Discipline in Faith, and Long-Term Wisdom",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Saturn transiting the ninth house tests belief systems, ethics, and long-term vision. Faith becomes practical and grounded through experience rather than blind belief. Relationships with mentors and father figures demand responsibility and patience. Higher education, legal matters, and long journeys progress slowly but steadily with disciplined effort. Questioning old philosophies is necessary for mature wisdom. When humility replaces rigidity, this transit builds ethical clarity, disciplined faith, and a resilient life direction.",
