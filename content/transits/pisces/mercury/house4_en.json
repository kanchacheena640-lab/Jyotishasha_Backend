  "title": "Mercury Transit in Fourth House: Thoughtful Home Decisions, Emotional Dialogue, and Inner Clarity",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mercury transiting the fourth house turns attention toward home, family, and emotional foundations. Conversations at home increase, focusing on comfort, security, and practical arrangements. Decisions related to property, relocation, or home-based work require analysis and planning. Emotional intelligence improves through dialogue, though overthinking can disturb inner peace. When communication remains calm and structured, this transit supports mental clarity, harmonious domestic exchanges, and thoughtful choices that strengthen inner stability.",
