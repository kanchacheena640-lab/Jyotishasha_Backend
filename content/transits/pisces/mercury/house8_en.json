  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mercury transiting the eighth house sharpens investigative thinking and brings focus to shared finances, secrets, and deep psychological patterns. Conversations turn serious and probing, favoring research, audits, and problem-solving behind the scenes. Matters related to taxes, insurance, inheritances, or joint assets require clarity and documentation. Mental intensity can rise, so avoiding suspicion or overanalysis is important. When curiosity is disciplined, this transit supports strategic insight, honest disclosures, and intelligent handling of complex situations.",
