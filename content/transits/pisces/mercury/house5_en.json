  "title": "Mercury Transit in Fifth House: Creative Intelligence, Playful Romance, and Smart Learning",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mercury transiting the fifth house sharpens creative intelligence, curiosity, and expressive confidence. Ideas flow with wit, making learning enjoyable and communication playful. Romance feels lighter, driven by conversation and shared interests rather than intensity. Education, writing, and performance benefit from quick thinking, though distraction can dilute focus. Children-related matters improve through dialogue and guidance. When creativity is structured and attention is sustained, this transit supports joyful learning, clever expression, and intelligent pleasure.",
