  "title": "Mercury Transit in Eleventh House: Strategic Networking, Smart Gains, and Goal-Oriented Thinking",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mercury transiting the eleventh house sharpens goal-setting, networking, and income-related planning. Conversations revolve around aspirations, collaborations, and future strategies. Friends, teams, and professional circles become important sources of ideas and opportunities. Gains come through communication, data, and intelligent coordination rather than force. However, overanalysis of results or frequent opinion changes can slow momentum. When thinking stays focused and communication remains consistent, this transit supports smart gains, influential connections, and steady progress toward long-term objectives.",
