  "title": "Mercury Transit in Sixth House: Analytical Work, Problem-Solving, and Mental Discipline",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mercury transiting the sixth house sharpens analytical ability and focuses the mind on routines, work efficiency, and problem-solving. You become detail-oriented in daily tasks, capable of handling competition and resolving conflicts through logic. Health matters benefit from informed decisions and structured habits. Communication at work turns precise but can become overly critical if unchecked. When intellect is applied with patience and balance, this transit supports productivity, skill refinement, and steady improvement in service-oriented roles.",
