  "title": "Mercury Transit in Twelfth House: Quiet Thinking, Behind-the-Scenes Planning, and Inner Clarity",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mercury transiting the twelfth house turns the mind inward, favoring reflection, research, and behind-the-scenes planning. Communication becomes selective, private, and purposeful, supporting confidential work, writing, and strategic preparation. Expenses related to learning, travel, or tools may rise and need tracking. Overthinking in isolation can disturb rest, so mental hygiene matters. When thoughts are organized and intentions clear, this transit supports silent productivity, spiritual study, and smart preparation for future moves.",
