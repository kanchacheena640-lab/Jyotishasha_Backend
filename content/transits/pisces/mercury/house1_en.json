  "title": "Mercury Transit in First House: Expressive Identity, Mental Agility, and Adaptive Thinking",
  "summary": "For Pisces Ascendant, Mercury transiting the first house sharpens self-expression, communication, and mental responsiveness. Thoughts flow quickly and curiosity rises, making you more articulate, adaptable, and engaged with your surroundings. You may feel compelled to speak your mind, learn new skills, or rebrand your personal image. Nervous energy can increase if overstimulation is unchecked. When clarity guides speech, this transit enhances confidence, persuasive ability, and the power to present ideas with sensitivity and intelligence.",
