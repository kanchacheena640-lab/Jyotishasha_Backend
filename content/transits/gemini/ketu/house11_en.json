  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 11th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the eleventh house reduces attachment to large social circles, gains, and expectation-driven goals. You may become selective about friendships and networks, preferring meaningful connections over numbers. Desire for recognition through groups fades, while independent aims strengthen. Gains can feel irregular, but clarity improves when goals are simplified and self-aligned.",
