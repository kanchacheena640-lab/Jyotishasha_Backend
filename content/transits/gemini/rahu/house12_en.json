  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 12th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Rahu transiting the twelfth house heightens themes of isolation, hidden expenses, foreign connections, and subconscious patterns. Interest in retreat, research, or behind-the-scenes work increases. This phase can bring sudden overseas links or unconventional spiritual curiosity, but also sleep disruption or financial leakages. Awareness, boundaries, and disciplined routines turn withdrawal into meaningful renewal.",
