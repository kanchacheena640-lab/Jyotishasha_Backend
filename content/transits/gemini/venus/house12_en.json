  "title": "Venus Transit in the 12th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Venus transiting the twelfth house turns affection inward, heightening compassion, solitude, and subtle pleasures. Love expresses quietly through care, sacrifice, and behind-the-scenes support. This phase favors healing, creativity in isolation, spiritual retreats, and foreign connections. While empathy and artistic sensitivity rise, escapism, secret attachments, or untracked expenses can dilute clarity if boundaries are not maintained.",
