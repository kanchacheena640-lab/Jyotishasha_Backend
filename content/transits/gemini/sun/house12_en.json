  "title": "Sun Transit in the 12th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Sun transiting the 12th house for Gemini Ascendant turns focus inward, emphasizing withdrawal, expenditure, and behind-the-scenes authority. Visibility reduces externally while inner motivations, subconscious patterns, and spiritual priorities surface. Expenses related to travel, health, or institutions may rise, demanding conscious budgeting. Leadership expresses quietly through planning, research, or service roles away from the spotlight. This transit tests ego attachment to recognition. When embraced with discipline and clarity, the Sun strengthens inner confidence, spiritual insight, and strategic preparation for the next outward cycle.",
