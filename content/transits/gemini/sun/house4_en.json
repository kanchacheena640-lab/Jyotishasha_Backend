  "title": "Sun Transit in the 4th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Sun transiting the 4th house for Gemini Ascendant highlights inner security, home dynamics, and emotional authority. Focus turns toward domestic responsibilities, property matters, and personal foundations. The need to lead or control within the home can increase, sometimes creating tension with family members, especially the mother figure. Emotional expression becomes firm rather than flexible. This transit tests balance between authority and care. When guided by empathy, the Sun strengthens inner stability, responsible decision-making, and a dignified domestic environment.",
