  "title": "Sun Transit in the 7th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Sun transiting the 7th house for Gemini Ascendant brings focus to partnerships, marriage, and public dealings. The urge to lead or dominate within one-to-one relationships increases, making balance essential. Business collaborations and client interactions gain visibility, but ego clashes can arise if authority is imposed rather than shared. This transit tests cooperation, fairness, and mutual respect. When guided by diplomacy and listening, the Sun strengthens strategic alliances, improves public reputation, and brings clarity in relationship commitments.",
