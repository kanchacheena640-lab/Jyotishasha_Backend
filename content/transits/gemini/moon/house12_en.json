  "title": "Moon Transit in the 12th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Moon transiting the 12th house for Gemini Ascendant turns emotions inward, heightening sensitivity, introspection, and the need for withdrawal. Mental restlessness seeks quiet spaces, solitude, or spiritual grounding. Sleep patterns and emotional energy may fluctuate, with subconscious thoughts surfacing more strongly. Expenses or losses can feel emotionally charged, requiring mindful management. This transit tests emotional containment and release. When supported by rest and reflection, the Moon enhances compassion, inner awareness, and emotional healing through conscious detachment.",
