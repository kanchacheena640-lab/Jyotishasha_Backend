  "title": "Moon Transit in the 8th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Moon transiting the 8th house for Gemini Ascendant intensifies emotional depth, vulnerability, and subconscious awareness. Feelings become private and intense, bringing sensitivity around trust, shared resources, and hidden matters. Mood fluctuations may arise from uncertainty related to joint finances, intimacy, or sudden changes. Mental restlessness combines with emotional undercurrents, requiring grounding practices. This transit tests emotional security in situations beyond control. When processed consciously, the Moon supports psychological insight, emotional resilience, and the ability to navigate transformation with maturity.",
