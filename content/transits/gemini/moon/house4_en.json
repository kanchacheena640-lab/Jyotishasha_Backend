  "title": "Moon Transit in the 4th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Moon transiting the 4th house for Gemini Ascendant intensifies emotional focus on home, inner security, and family bonds. The need for comfort, stability, and familiar surroundings increases, making domestic matters central to well-being. Mood fluctuations are closely tied to the home environment and interactions with the mother or caregivers. Property or relocation thoughts may arise, guided more by feelings than logic. This transit emphasizes emotional grounding. When nurtured consciously, the Moon supports inner peace, family harmony, and a stronger sense of belonging.",
