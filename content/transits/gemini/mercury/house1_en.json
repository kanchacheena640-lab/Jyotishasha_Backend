  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 1st House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits your first house, it directly influences your mind, speech, and self-expression. This is a phase where your thoughts become sharper and your words carry more impact. You may feel more curious, alert, and mentally active, with a strong urge to express ideas or initiate conversations. This transit supports learning, planning, and personal rebranding, but overthinking or nervous energy can surface if the mind is not grounded.",
