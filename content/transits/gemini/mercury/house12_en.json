  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 12th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury’s transit through the twelfth house turns the mind inward and highlights solitude, reflection, and behind-the-scenes activity. Thoughts become more private, imaginative, and introspective. This phase supports research, spiritual study, and work done away from the spotlight. While intuition and subtle understanding increase, mental overthinking or isolation can rise if communication is completely withdrawn.",
