  "title": "Mars Transit in the 7th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the 7th house for Gemini Ascendant intensifies interactions within partnerships, contracts, and public dealings. Assertiveness rises in one-to-one dynamics, bringing passion, initiative, and a desire to take the lead in relationships. However, impatience and competitiveness can provoke arguments or power struggles with partners, clients, or opponents. Legal or business negotiations may become confrontational if emotions run high. This transit tests balance between assertion and cooperation. When managed with restraint, Mars strengthens decisive partnerships, clear boundaries, and dynamic collaboration.",
