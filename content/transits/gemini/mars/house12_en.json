  "title": "Mars Transit in the 12th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the 12th house for Gemini Ascendant redirects energy inward, increasing restlessness, hidden effort, and subconscious agitation. Actions may occur behind the scenes, with motivation driven by unresolved pressures or the need for withdrawal. Sleep, expenses, and emotional leakage require attention, as impulsive reactions can drain energy. This transit tests control over hidden anger and scattered drive. When channeled through disciplined solitude, service, or spiritual practice, Mars supports strategic retreat, quiet strength, and effective closure of lingering conflicts.",
