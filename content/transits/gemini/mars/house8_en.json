  "title": "Mars Transit in the 8th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the 8th house for Gemini Ascendant intensifies pressure around transformation, shared resources, and hidden dynamics. The urge to confront fears and uncover truths increases, but impatience can provoke crises related to joint finances, intimacy, or trust. Emotional reactions may turn defensive when control feels threatened. This transit activates risk-taking tendencies and sudden actions. When handled with restraint and strategic focus, Mars supports decisive problem-solving, crisis management, and the courage to navigate deep change without destructive impulsivity.",
