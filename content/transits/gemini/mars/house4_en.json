  "title": "Mars Transit in the 4th House for Gemini Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the 4th house for Gemini Ascendant agitates the inner emotional base, home environment, and domestic responsibilities. A strong urge to take control of household matters emerges, but impatience can create tension with family members. Emotional reactions may feel sharp, especially regarding comfort, property, or personal space. Real estate or vehicle-related actions may be initiated hastily. This transit tests emotional containment and domestic discipline. When directed constructively, Mars supports decisive home improvements, boundary-setting, and inner strength through purposeful action.",
