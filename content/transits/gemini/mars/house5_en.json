  "summary": "Mars transiting the 5th house for Gemini Ascendant intensifies creative drive, competitive spirit, and the urge for self-expression. Passion rises in romance, performance, and speculative pursuits, pushing bold moves and quick decisions. Intellectual risk-taking increases, though impatience can disrupt focus or provoke ego clashes. Engagement with children or creative projects becomes action-oriented. This transit tests discipline in pleasure and judgment. When guided with restraint, Mars fuels confident creativity, strategic courage, and results-driven expression without reckless excess.",
