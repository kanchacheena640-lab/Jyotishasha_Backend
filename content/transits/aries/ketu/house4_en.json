  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 4th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your 4th house brings detachment from emotional comfort, home life, and familiar security. This phase reduces attachment to domestic matters and challenges your sense of inner peace. You may feel disconnected from family routines or less interested in property and material comforts. While emotional withdrawal can feel unsettling, it also supports inner independence and spiritual grounding. Ketu asks you to redefine stability from within, rather than relying on external comfort or familiar environments.",
