  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 7th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your 7th house brings detachment and karmic testing in partnerships, marriage, and public dealings. This phase reduces emotional dependence on others and challenges expectations from relationships. You may feel withdrawn, indifferent, or unclear about commitment, while partnerships demand maturity and realism. Business alliances can feel transactional or temporary. Ketu dissolves illusion in one-to-one dynamics, pushing you to redefine balance, boundaries, and equality. When approached consciously, this transit promotes self-reliance and mature relationship understanding.",
