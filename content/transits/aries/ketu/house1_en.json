  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 1st House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your 1st house brings detachment from ego, identity, and personal image. This phase reduces the need for validation and pushes you toward introspection and inner clarity. You may feel less motivated to project yourself outwardly, creating a sense of withdrawal or identity confusion. While confidence may fluctuate, spiritual awareness and self-understanding deepen. Ketu dissolves false self-concepts, demanding authenticity. When consciously handled, this transit supports inner liberation rather than loss of direction or vitality.",
