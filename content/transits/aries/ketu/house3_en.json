  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 3rd House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your 3rd house brings detachment from constant activity, communication, and ego-driven effort. This phase reduces the urge to prove courage or dominate through action, shifting focus toward selective and purposeful expression. Initiative becomes inwardly guided rather than reactive. Relationships with siblings and peers may feel distant or minimal, while mental energy turns introspective. Ketu here favors silent strength, skill refinement, and mindful action over noise and visibility, demanding patience and consistency rather than impulsive effort.",
