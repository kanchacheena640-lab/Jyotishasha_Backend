  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 11th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your 11th house brings detachment from large social circles, material gains, and expectation-driven ambitions. This phase reduces interest in networking for profit or validation, making friendships feel selective or distant. Long-term goals may lose urgency unless they align with inner purpose. While gains can still occur, emotional satisfaction from achievements decreases. Ketu filters superficial associations and unrealistic desires, redirecting focus toward meaningful contribution rather than numbers, popularity, or external success metrics.",
