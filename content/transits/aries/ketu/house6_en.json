  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 6th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your 6th house creates detachment from routine struggles, competition, and daily conflicts. This phase weakens the urge to dominate rivals or prove strength through constant effort. Work and service feel duty-based rather than ambition-driven, while health requires mindful attention due to neglect or irregular habits. Although motivation to fight obstacles reduces, Ketu sharpens problem awareness and karmic resolution. When handled consciously, this transit supports silent victories, healing patterns, and release from repetitive stress cycles.",
