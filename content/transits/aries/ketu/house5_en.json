  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 5th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your 5th house brings detachment from recognition, romance-driven validation, and ego-based creativity. This phase reduces the urge to seek appreciation for talent, intelligence, or emotional expression. Romantic involvement may feel distant or non-attached, while speculative instincts weaken. Although joy and excitement seem muted, this transit sharpens discernment and supports intellectual clarity. Ketu redirects focus from emotional display toward inner wisdom, making creativity more refined, purposeful, and less dependent on external response.",
