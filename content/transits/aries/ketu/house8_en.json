  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 8th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your 8th house intensifies detachment from fear, control, and deep emotional dependency. This phase brings sudden inner shifts, karmic closures, and a strong pull toward understanding hidden truths. Interest in psychology, healing, or occult knowledge may rise, while trust and vulnerability are tested. Shared finances or inheritances may feel distant or confusing. Ketu dissolves attachment to survival-based anxieties, demanding surrender rather than control. Conscious awareness helps transform uncertainty into profound inner liberation.",
