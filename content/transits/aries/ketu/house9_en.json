  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 9th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your 9th house brings detachment from rigid belief systems, external guidance, and inherited philosophies. This phase weakens blind faith in doctrines, teachers, or moral frameworks, pushing you toward inner truth-seeking. Long-distance travel or higher learning may feel purposeless unless aligned with deeper meaning. Confusion with mentors or father figures can arise, yet spiritual insight deepens through self-inquiry. Ketu dissolves borrowed wisdom, demanding experiential understanding rather than belief-driven direction.",
