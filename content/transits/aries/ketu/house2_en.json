  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 2nd House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your 2nd house brings detachment from material security, wealth accumulation, and rigid family values. This phase reduces attachment to possessions and challenges your relationship with money and speech. You may feel indifferent toward savings or status symbols, while communication becomes minimal or blunt. Although this transit can weaken material motivation temporarily, it sharpens inner values and ethical clarity. Conscious financial discipline is required so that detachment does not turn into neglect or instability.",
