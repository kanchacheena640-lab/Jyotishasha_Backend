  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 12th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your 12th house deepens withdrawal from material attachment, routine engagement, and visible worldly pursuits. This phase heightens detachment, solitude, and subconscious processing, drawing attention toward inner liberation rather than external achievement. Expenses may feel meaningless, sleep patterns can shift, and isolation may increase. While confusion or escapism is possible, this transit strongly supports spiritual insight, karmic release, and inner clarity. When handled consciously, Ketu here transforms loss into freedom and solitude into profound self-awareness.",
