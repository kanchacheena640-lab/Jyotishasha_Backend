  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 12th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Rahu transiting your 12th house heightens focus on isolation, expenses, foreign connections, and subconscious patterns. This phase can increase withdrawal from routine life, interest in spiritual or hidden realms, and involvement with distant places. While foreign opportunities, research, or behind-the-scenes work may grow, confusion, escapism, and uncontrolled expenses can also rise. Rahu magnifies inner fears and desires, making emotional clarity essential. When handled consciously, this transit supports deep inner awareness rather than loss of direction or energy.",
