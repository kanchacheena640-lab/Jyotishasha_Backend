  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 5th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Rahu transiting your 5th house activates creativity, intellect, romance, speculation, and matters related to children. This phase intensifies the urge to stand out through talent, ideas, or unconventional self-expression. Romantic attraction can feel intense but confusing, while speculative instincts may become risky if driven by illusion. Rahu here magnifies desires connected to recognition and validation, often testing judgment. When handled with discipline, this transit supports creative breakthroughs and strategic thinking rather than impulsive emotional choices.",
