  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 8th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Rahu transiting your 8th house triggers deep transformation, hidden matters, shared resources, and psychological intensity. This phase brings sudden events, secrecy, and heightened curiosity toward the unknown. You may feel drawn to research, occult subjects, or complex financial arrangements, while emotional vulnerability and trust issues surface. Gains through inheritance, insurance, or partner’s resources are possible, but instability and fear-based decisions must be avoided. Rahu here demands inner strength, transparency, and emotional maturity to navigate unpredictable shifts wisely.",
