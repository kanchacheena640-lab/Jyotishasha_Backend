  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 2nd House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Rahu transiting your 2nd house shifts focus toward wealth, speech, family values, and material security. This phase intensifies the desire for financial growth, recognition through speech, and unconventional income sources. You may feel driven to accumulate quickly, sometimes bypassing traditional norms. While this transit can bring sudden financial opportunities, it can also distort priorities, create instability in savings, or strain family harmony. Conscious financial discipline and mindful communication are essential to avoid long-term imbalance.",
