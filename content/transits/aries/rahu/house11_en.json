  "summary": "Rahu transiting your 11th house amplifies ambitions, social networks, gains, and long-term aspirations. This phase heightens the desire to achieve goals quickly through influential circles, technology, or unconventional platforms. Sudden gains, powerful connections, and expanded reach are possible, but expectations may become unrealistic. Friendships can turn strategic, and group dynamics may involve hidden motives. Rahu tests your ability to balance ambition with ethics, ensuring that growth is sustainable rather than driven purely by opportunism or illusion.",
