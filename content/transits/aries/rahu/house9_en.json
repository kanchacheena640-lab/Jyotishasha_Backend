  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 9th House for Aries Ascendant",
  "summary": "Rahu transiting your 9th house challenges belief systems, long-term vision, higher education, and guidance from mentors. This phase provokes questioning of traditional values, pushing you toward unconventional philosophies or foreign influences. Travel for learning or purpose may increase, while conflicts with teachers, father figures, or moral frameworks can arise. Rahu expands curiosity but can distort judgment if rebellion replaces wisdom. Conscious discernment helps transform ideological confusion into a broader, more inclusive understanding of purpose and direction.",
