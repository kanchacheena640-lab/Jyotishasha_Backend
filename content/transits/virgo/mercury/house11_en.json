  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 11th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits your 11th house, thinking aligns with goals, gains, and networks. Communication with friends, teams, and professional circles increases, making this a strong phase for planning targets and exchanging ideas. You analyze profits, outcomes, and future possibilities with clarity. This transit supports networking, collaborations, and strategy building. However, excessive calculation or comparison can reduce satisfaction. Progress improves when ideas are shared clearly, expectations are realistic, and intellectual exchange is used to strengthen long-term objectives.",
