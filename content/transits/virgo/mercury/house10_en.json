  "summary": "When Mercury transits your 10th house, career, reputation, and decision-making take center stage. Communication with seniors, clients, and authorities increases, making your words visible and impactful. This is a strong phase for planning, reporting, strategy, and role clarity. Your professional image is shaped by how clearly you think and speak. However, overexplaining or frequent changes in stance can weaken authority. Consistent messaging, data-backed decisions, and disciplined communication strengthen credibility and long-term progress.",
