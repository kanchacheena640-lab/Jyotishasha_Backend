  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 1st House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits your 1st house, mental activity, communication style, and self-expression become highly prominent. You think quickly, speak clearly, and feel driven to present ideas confidently. Curiosity rises, along with a need to analyze situations and explain your viewpoint. This transit supports learning, planning, and networking, but overthinking or nervous energy can affect decisiveness. Best results come from structuring thoughts, listening actively, and using intellect to guide actions rather than reacting impulsively.",
