  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 8th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits your 8th house, thinking turns deep, investigative, and strategic. You focus on hidden matters, shared resources, research, and psychological understanding. Conversations may revolve around finances tied to others, taxes, insurance, or confidential topics. This transit supports analysis, audits, and uncovering facts, but excessive suspicion or mental fixation can create stress. Best results come from using clarity and discretion together, asking precise questions, and channeling curiosity into structured research rather than worry or overthinking.",
