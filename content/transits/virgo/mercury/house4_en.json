  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 4th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits your 4th house, mental focus shifts toward home, family, property, and emotional foundations. Conversations within the family increase, and decisions related to residence, vehicles, or real estate come to the forefront. You prefer rational discussion over emotional reactions at home. This transit supports planning renovations, paperwork, and learning from home, but overthinking domestic matters can disturb inner peace. Balance comes from clear communication, practical decisions, and maintaining emotional sensitivity alongside logic.",
