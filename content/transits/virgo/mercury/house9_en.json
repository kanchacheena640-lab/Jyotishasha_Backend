  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 9th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits your 9th house, thinking expands toward beliefs, higher learning, and long-term direction. You become curious about philosophy, law, education, and cultural perspectives, seeking logic behind principles. Communication with mentors, teachers, or guides increases, and plans related to travel or studies gain momentum. This transit favors structured learning, teaching, and advisory roles. However, excessive debate or rigid opinions can create friction. Progress comes from open-minded discussion, factual clarity, and practical application of knowledge.",
