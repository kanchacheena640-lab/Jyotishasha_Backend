  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 12th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits your 12th house, mental activity turns inward toward reflection, planning, and hidden processes. Thoughts focus on closure, solitude, foreign matters, and behind-the-scenes work. Communication becomes selective, and you may prefer privacy over constant interaction. This transit supports research, strategy, spiritual study, and work done quietly. However, overthinking, anxiety, or scattered sleep patterns can arise. Best results come from structured introspection, clear mental boundaries, and using solitude to refine ideas before execution.",
