  "summary": "When Mercury transits your 7th house, communication becomes central to partnerships, agreements, and public interactions. Dialogue with spouse, business partners, and clients increases, making negotiations and contracts more active. You seek intellectual balance in relationships and prefer logic over emotion. This transit supports deals, consultations, and collaborative planning. However, excessive analysis or argument over details can strain bonds. Clear terms, active listening, and respectful exchange help include others’ perspectives while keeping discussions productive and mutually beneficial.",
