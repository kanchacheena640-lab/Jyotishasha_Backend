  "title": "Saturn in 4th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 4th house for Virgo Ascendant, it restructures emotional security, home life, property matters, and inner stability. Responsibilities related to family, residence, or mother figures increase, requiring patience and practical solutions. Emotional expression becomes reserved, and comfort must be built through discipline rather than ease. Property or vehicle matters progress slowly but securely. This transit emphasizes long-term foundations, emotional maturity, and inner strength developed through duty and consistency rather than immediate comfort.",
