Daily routines become demanding but productive, pushing you to refine skills and handle responsibilities with endurance. This phase favors service-oriented roles, compliance, and structured problem-solving. Enemies and obstacles are handled steadily through persistence rather than confrontation. Health improves with strict routines, though neglect can cause chronic strain. Long-term success comes from consistency, accountability, and practical effort.",
