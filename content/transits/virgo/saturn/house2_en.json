  "title": "Saturn in 2nd House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 2nd house for Virgo Ascendant, it restructures finances, speech, and family responsibilities. Money matters demand discipline, patience, and long-term planning. Income may feel delayed, but stability improves through consistent effort and conservative choices. Speech becomes measured and serious, sometimes perceived as reserved. Family duties increase, requiring practical support. This transit favors saving, value-based decisions, and building wealth slowly. Short-term scarcity teaches financial maturity and strengthens self-worth rooted in responsibility.",
