  "title": "Saturn in 12th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 12th house for Virgo Ascendant, it emphasizes withdrawal, discipline behind the scenes, and karmic closure. Expenses become controlled yet unavoidable, pushing careful planning and minimalism. Solitude, isolation, or foreign connections gain importance for structured inner work rather than escape. Sleep, mental health, and subconscious fears require attention through routine and accountability. This transit supports long-term spiritual discipline, research, and service in secluded environments, while discouraging avoidance, secrecy, or escapist habits.",
