This phase supports deep learning, healing, and understanding of complex matters rather than outward expansion. Sudden events push personal growth through maturity and wisdom. Interest in psychology, spirituality, or occult subjects increases. Financial matters linked to inheritance, insurance, or shared assets require careful handling.
