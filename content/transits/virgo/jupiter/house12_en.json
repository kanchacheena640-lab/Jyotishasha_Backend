  "title": "Jupiter in 12th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Jupiter transits the 12th house for Virgo Ascendant, it shifts focus toward introspection, spirituality, foreign connections, and expenses tied to growth. This period supports inner expansion, charity, healing, and learning through isolation or distance. Foreign travel, overseas work, or spiritual retreats may become relevant. Expenses increase, but often for meaningful purposes such as education, health, or service. Results manifest subtly rather than publicly. This transit favors inner peace, ethical detachment, and long-term spiritual development over material visibility.",
