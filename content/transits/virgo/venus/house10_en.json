  "summary": "When Venus transits the 10th house for Virgo Ascendant, it enhances public image, career harmony, and professional relationships. This phase supports recognition through diplomacy, aesthetics, and people skills rather than forceful authority. Careers linked to design, beauty, media, hospitality, or client management benefit strongly. Workplace interactions become smoother, improving reputation and visibility. Progress comes through cooperation and refined conduct. However, overdependence on approval or mixing emotions with authority should be avoided to maintain credibility and long-term professional stability.",
