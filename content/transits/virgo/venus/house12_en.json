  "summary": "When Venus transits the 12th house for Virgo Ascendant, it emphasizes privacy, emotional release, foreign connections, and expenses tied to comfort or relationships. This phase heightens sensitivity, compassion, and the need for solitude or retreat. Love may express quietly or through distant or foreign links.
