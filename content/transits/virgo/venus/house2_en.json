This period enhances sweetness in communication and brings a refined approach toward money and possessions. Financial gains come through diplomacy, creativity, or relationship-based efforts. Family harmony improves, and material comforts increase. However, indulgence in luxury, food, or spending can rise if discipline is ignored.
