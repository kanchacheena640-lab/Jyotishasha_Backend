  "title": "Mars Transit in the 8th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits your 8th house, intense energy activates transformation, hidden matters, and shared resources. You may feel driven to confront fears, secrets, or unresolved issues head-on. Sudden situations can trigger strong reactions, especially around trust, intimacy, or joint finances. This transit sharpens investigative instincts and crisis-handling ability, but impulsive responses can escalate conflicts. Constructive outcomes arise when courage is applied with restraint, allowing deep change without self-destructive tendencies or unnecessary power struggles.",
