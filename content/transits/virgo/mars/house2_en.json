  "title": "Mars Transit in the 2nd House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits your 2nd house, assertive energy targets finances, values, and speech. You may feel driven to secure resources, increase income, or defend personal priorities. This phase can sharpen ambition around money but also trigger impulsive spending or blunt communication. Family discussions may turn heated if patience is low. Productive outcomes come from disciplined budgeting and measured speech. Channeling effort into skill-building and sustainable income protects stability while converting intensity into tangible results.",
