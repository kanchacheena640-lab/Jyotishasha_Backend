  "summary": "When Mars transits your 5th house, assertive energy fuels creativity, passion, and self-expression. You may feel driven to take risks in romance, speculation, or creative pursuits. Competitive instincts rise, pushing you to prove talent or leadership. This transit can intensify attraction and desire for recognition, but impatience may trigger conflicts in love or with children. Productive outcomes emerge when courage is paired with discipline, channeling enthusiasm into focused creation rather than impulsive display.",
