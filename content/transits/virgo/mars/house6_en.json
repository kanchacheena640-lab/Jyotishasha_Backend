  "title": "Mars Transit in the 6th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits your 6th house, energy targets work discipline, competition, and problem-solving. You feel driven to tackle challenges, outperform rivals, and correct inefficiencies. This phase strengthens resilience and courage in demanding routines, but impatience can spark conflicts with coworkers or subordinates. Health requires attention, especially inflammation or stress-related strain. Productive results come from channeling intensity into structured effort, clear priorities, and consistent habits rather than confrontational tactics.",
