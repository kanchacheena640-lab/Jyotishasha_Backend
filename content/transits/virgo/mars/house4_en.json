  "title": "Mars Transit in the 4th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits your 4th house, energy turns inward toward home, property, and emotional security. Domestic matters demand action, sometimes bringing restlessness or tension within the household. You may feel driven to fix, renovate, relocate, or assert control over personal space. Emotions can run hot at home, especially if frustrations are suppressed. This transit supports decisive moves related to property and foundations, but peace is maintained only when assertiveness is balanced with patience and emotional restraint.",
