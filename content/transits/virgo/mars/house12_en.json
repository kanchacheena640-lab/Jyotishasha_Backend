  "title": "Mars Transit in the 12th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits your 12th house, energy turns inward and works behind the scenes. Actions may feel hidden, delayed, or isolated, yet intense effort continues quietly. Expenses rise due to travel, health, or unresolved matters, requiring restraint. Suppressed anger or frustration can disturb sleep and peace if not released constructively. This transit supports disciplined solitude, strategic planning, and closure of pending issues. Progress comes from controlled action, emotional release, and conserving energy rather than open confrontation.",
