  "summary": "When Mars transits your 1st house, energy, drive, and assertiveness rise sharply. You feel motivated to take action, defend your position, and push personal agendas forward. Physical vitality increases, but impatience and irritability can also surface. This is a strong phase for initiating tasks and improving self-discipline, provided aggression is controlled. How you project anger, confidence, and leadership directly shapes outcomes during this transit.",
