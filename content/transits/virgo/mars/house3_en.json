  "title": "Mars Transit in the 3rd House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits your 3rd house, energy channels into communication, initiative, and skill-building. Courage to take risks increases, pushing you to speak directly, act decisively, and pursue short-term goals. This phase favors writing, sales, marketing, and hands-on efforts, but impatience can trigger arguments with siblings or peers. Travel and daily hustle intensify. Results improve when assertiveness is paired with strategy, timing, and respectful dialogue rather than impulsive reactions.",
