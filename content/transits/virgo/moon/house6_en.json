  "title": "Moon Transit in the 6th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits your 6th house, emotional energy turns toward work routines, responsibilities, and problem-solving. You may feel mentally occupied with tasks, deadlines, and day-to-day efficiency. Health awareness increases, and small imbalances are noticed quickly. Emotional reactions to colleagues or subordinates can surface, making patience essential. This transit supports service, discipline, and practical adjustments, provided emotions are managed calmly and stress is not allowed to accumulate through overthinking or self-criticism.",
