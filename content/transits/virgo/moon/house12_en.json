  "title": "Moon Transit in the 12th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits your 12th house, emotional energy withdraws inward, increasing sensitivity, solitude, and reflection. You may feel the need to disconnect from noise and external demands. Sleep patterns, dreams, and subconscious thoughts become more active. Expenses may rise, often linked to comfort, travel, or emotional coping. This transit supports emotional release and healing, but confusion or emotional drain can occur if boundaries are weak. Balance improves through rest, privacy, and conscious emotional processing.",
