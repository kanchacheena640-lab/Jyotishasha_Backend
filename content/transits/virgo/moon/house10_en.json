  "title": "Moon Transit in the 10th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits your 10th house, emotions become closely tied to career, public image, and responsibilities. You may feel emotionally driven to achieve recognition or reassurance through work and authority figures. Professional matters influence mood strongly, making success feel uplifting and setbacks emotionally heavy. Public interactions and reputation demand sensitivity. This transit supports responsiveness and adaptability in career roles, but emotional decision-making or dependence on approval can create instability if boundaries and priorities are not clearly defined.",
