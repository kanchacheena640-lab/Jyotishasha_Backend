  "title": "Moon Transit in the 8th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits your 8th house, emotions turn inward and intensify around hidden matters, trust, and transformation. You may feel psychologically sensitive, with moods influenced by fears, secrets, or sudden changes. Joint finances, shared responsibilities, or unresolved emotional issues can surface. This transit heightens intuition but also emotional vulnerability. While external stability may feel uncertain, inner awareness deepens. Emotional balance improves by observing feelings without reacting impulsively and by avoiding obsessive or secretive tendencies.",
