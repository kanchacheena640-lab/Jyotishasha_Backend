  "title": "Moon Transit in the 4th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits your 4th house, emotional focus shifts toward home, inner security, and personal comfort. You may feel a stronger need for emotional grounding and familiar surroundings. Family matters, domestic responsibilities, and property-related concerns come to the forefront. Mood tends to fluctuate based on the home environment and emotional support received. This transit supports nurturing, rest, and emotional healing, but overattachment or sensitivity can disturb balance if inner stability is not maintained.",
