  "title": "Moon Transit in the 1st House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits your 1st house, emotions, instincts, and self-perception come to the forefront. You may feel more sensitive to your surroundings and responsive to others’ reactions. This phase heightens mood fluctuations and personal awareness, influencing how you present yourself. Physical appearance, health, and daily habits draw attention. While intuition is strong, emotional reactivity can increase. Grounding routines and mindful expression help you channel feelings constructively and maintain balance during this emotionally active transit.",
