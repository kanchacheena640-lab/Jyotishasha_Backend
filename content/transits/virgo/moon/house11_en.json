  "title": "Moon Transit in the 11th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits your 11th house, emotions connect strongly with goals, gains, and social networks. You may feel emotionally invested in achievements, friendships, and collective support. Expectations from friends or groups can influence your mood, bringing moments of excitement or disappointment. Financial gains or recognition may fluctuate emotionally rather than practically. This transit favors collaboration and future planning, but emotional dependency on approval or results should be avoided to maintain inner stability and clear judgment.",
