  "title": "Moon Transit in the 2nd House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits your 2nd house, emotional focus shifts toward finances, family values, and speech. Your sense of security becomes closely tied to material stability and verbal reassurance. Spending patterns may fluctuate based on mood, and conversations with family members carry emotional weight. This transit heightens sensitivity around self-worth and resources. While intuition can guide financial decisions, impulsive reactions should be avoided. Stability improves when emotions are grounded and communication remains measured and respectful.",
