  "title": "Moon Transit in the 7th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits your 7th house, emotional focus shifts toward partnerships, relationships, and one-to-one interactions. You become more sensitive to others’ moods and expectations, seeking emotional reassurance through companionship. Marriage, business partnerships, and client relationships feel more emotionally charged. Reactions can fluctuate based on how supported or understood you feel. This transit favors cooperation and empathy, but dependency or overreaction can disturb balance. Stability grows when emotional needs are expressed clearly without surrendering personal equilibrium.",
