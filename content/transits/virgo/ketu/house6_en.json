  "title": "Ketu in 6th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 6th house for Virgo Ascendant, detachment develops toward conflicts, competition, and routine struggles. There is a quiet ability to overcome obstacles without aggression, relying on intuition rather than confrontation. Daily work feels mechanical, and motivation to prove oneself reduces. This phase supports service, healing, and problem-solving done silently, but neglecting health routines or responsibilities can invite imbalance. Conscious discipline is required to convert detachment into efficient execution rather than avoidance.",
