  "title": "Ketu in 11th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 11th house for Virgo Ascendant, detachment grows around ambitions, social circles, and large goals. Desire for recognition through networks or groups weakens, and friendships may feel selective or distant. Gains arrive irregularly, often through past efforts rather than active pursuit. This phase supports clarity about true goals and freedom from comparison, but withdrawal from opportunities can limit growth. Conscious participation and clear prioritization help balance detachment with sustainable progress.",
