  "title": "Ketu in 8th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 8th house for Virgo Ascendant, detachment deepens around control, shared resources, and emotional intensity. Sudden changes trigger inner withdrawal rather than reaction. Interest grows in research, healing, psychology, and hidden systems, while dependency on others’ resources reduces. This phase can feel unsettling if clarity is resisted, yet it supports deep transformation through awareness. Financial secrecy or avoidance must be handled carefully. Stability comes from accepting impermanence and maintaining transparency in shared matters.",
