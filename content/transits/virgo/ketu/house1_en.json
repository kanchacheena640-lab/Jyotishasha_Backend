  "title": "Ketu in 1st House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 1st house for Virgo Ascendant, identity, confidence, and self-direction turn inward. There is detachment from personal image, reduced need for validation, and a subtle loss of interest in ego-driven pursuits. Clarity about the self may feel blurred, yet intuition and inner awareness sharpen. This phase supports self-observation, simplification, and spiritual grounding, but can weaken decisiveness or visibility if isolation increases. Balance introspection with practical action to avoid withdrawal or confusion.",
