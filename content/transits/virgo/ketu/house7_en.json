  "title": "Ketu in 7th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 7th house for Virgo Ascendant, detachment increases in partnerships, commitments, and one-to-one dynamics. There is reduced dependence on others for validation, and relationships may feel distant, karmic, or undefined. Business partnerships require clarity, as expectations can remain unspoken. This phase supports independence and self-awareness, but emotional withdrawal can weaken bonds if communication is avoided. Conscious engagement, clear agreements, and balanced boundaries are essential to maintain stability in personal and professional partnerships.",
