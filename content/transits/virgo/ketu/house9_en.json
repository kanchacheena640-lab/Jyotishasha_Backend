  "title": "Ketu in 9th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 9th house for Virgo Ascendant, detachment arises around belief systems, higher guidance, and long-held philosophies. Faith becomes inward and experiential rather than rule-based. Traditional mentors, institutions, or ideologies may feel limiting, prompting independent truth-seeking. Long-distance travel or higher education feels purposeful but stripped of excitement. This phase favors spiritual inquiry, inner ethics, and quiet wisdom, yet confusion can arise if direction is resisted. Grounded learning and humility help stabilize purpose and clarity.",
