  "title": "Ketu in 10th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 10th house for Virgo Ascendant, detachment develops toward status, authority, and public recognition. Career ambition becomes muted, and the drive to chase titles or visibility reduces. Work is approached as duty rather than identity, favoring meaningful contribution over applause. This phase supports independent paths, advisory roles, and behind-the-scenes responsibility, but confusion can arise if direction is unclear. Aligning career actions with inner values is essential to maintain stability and purpose during this transit.",
