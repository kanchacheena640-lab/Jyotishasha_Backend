  "title": "Ketu in 2nd House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 2nd house for Virgo Ascendant, detachment grows around money, possessions, speech, and family values. Financial motivation weakens, and priorities shift toward minimalism and inner security. Speech becomes brief, factual, or withdrawn, sometimes appearing indifferent. Family dynamics may feel distant or emotionally dry. This phase supports simplifying finances and redefining self-worth beyond material accumulation. However, neglecting practical planning or communication can create instability. Conscious budgeting and clear expression are necessary to maintain balance.",
