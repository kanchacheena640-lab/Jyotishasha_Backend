  "title": "Ketu in 12th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 12th house for Virgo Ascendant, detachment deepens toward material life, expenses, and external validation. Solitude, introspection, and spiritual inquiry increase naturally. There may be withdrawal from social noise, heightened intuition, and a strong pull toward meditation, research, or work done in isolation. Expenses can rise silently if awareness drops. This phase supports liberation from mental clutter and subconscious healing, provided discipline is maintained. Grounded routines help convert isolation into insight rather than escapism.",
