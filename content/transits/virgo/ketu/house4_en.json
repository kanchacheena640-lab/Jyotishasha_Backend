  "title": "Ketu in 4th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 4th house for Virgo Ascendant, emotional security, home comfort, and inner peace feel detached or unsettled. There is reduced attachment to property, residence, or domestic validation. Home may feel quiet, distant, or simply functional rather than emotionally nourishing. Matters related to mother or family roots can feel karmic or duty-bound. This phase supports inner grounding and emotional maturity, but neglecting emotional needs or family communication can create isolation. Conscious nurturing restores balance.",
