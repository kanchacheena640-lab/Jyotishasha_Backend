  "title": "Ketu in 3rd House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 3rd house for Virgo Ascendant, effort, communication, and courage become inwardly driven and selective. There is reduced interest in constant social interaction, short travels, or self-promotion. You act when necessary, not impulsively, preferring precision over volume. Relations with siblings may feel distant or detached. This phase supports focused skill refinement, research, and quiet competence, but passivity or hesitation can slow momentum. Intentional action and clear communication are needed to translate inner clarity into results.",
