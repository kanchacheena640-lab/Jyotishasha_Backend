  "title": "Ketu in 5th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 5th house for Virgo Ascendant, detachment develops around creativity, romance, pleasure, and recognition. Interest in validation, applause, or emotional drama reduces. Creative expression becomes inward, subtle, or purpose-driven rather than performative. Romantic matters may feel confusing, distant, or karmic in nature. This phase supports learning, research, mantra, and intellectual depth, but can dull joy if emotional expression is suppressed. Conscious engagement is required to keep inspiration, love, and confidence alive.",
