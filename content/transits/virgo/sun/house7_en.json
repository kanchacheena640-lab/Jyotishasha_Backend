  "summary": "When the Sun transits your 7th house, relationships, partnerships, and public dealings come into sharp focus. This phase highlights how you assert authority and identity through one-to-one interactions. Business partnerships, marriage dynamics, and client relationships may demand clarity and balance. Ego clashes can arise if mutual respect is missing. At the same time, this transit supports visibility, leadership, and decision-making in collaborations—provided you avoid dominance and prioritize fairness in commitments.",
