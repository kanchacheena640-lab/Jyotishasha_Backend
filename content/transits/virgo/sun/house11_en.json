  "summary": "When the Sun transits your 11th house, gains, ambitions, and social influence come into focus. This is a results-oriented phase where efforts made earlier start showing tangible outcomes. Your role within networks, teams, and professional circles becomes more visible. Leadership among peers can increase, but ego clashes within groups are possible if dominance is overplayed. Financial growth through career or authority figures is supported. Long-term goals feel achievable when aligned with collective cooperation and ethical intent.",
