  "title": "Sun Transit in the 12th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits your 12th house, focus turns inward toward solitude, closure, and hidden dimensions of life. This phase emphasizes rest, reflection, and withdrawal from excessive external engagement. Expenses may rise, especially related to travel, health, or spiritual pursuits. You may feel less visible or appreciated, prompting reassessment of ego and priorities. While outward progress appears slow, this transit is powerful for releasing old patterns, strengthening inner discipline, and preparing the ground for a fresh personal cycle ahead.",
