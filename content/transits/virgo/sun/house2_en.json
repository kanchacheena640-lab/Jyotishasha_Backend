  "summary": "The Sun transiting the second house highlights finances, speech, and personal values for Virgo ascendants. Focus shifts toward income stability, self-worth, and how authority is expressed through words. Confidence in financial decisions increases, but there can be rigidity in opinions or tone. Family responsibilities gain importance. When humility tempers authority, this transit strengthens material security and builds respect through responsible communication.",
