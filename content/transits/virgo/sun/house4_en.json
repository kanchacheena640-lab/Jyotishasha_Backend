  "title": "Sun Transit in the 4th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting the fourth house brings focus to home, emotional security, and inner foundations for Virgo ascendants. Domestic responsibilities increase, and the need to establish authority or order at home becomes strong. Relations with mother or family elders may feel formal or demanding. This phase supports property matters, discipline in personal life, and inner restructuring. When warmth balances authority, the Sun builds stable emotional roots.",
