  "title": "Sun Transit in the 8th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits your 8th house, focus shifts toward transformation, hidden matters, and deeper psychological patterns. This phase often brings attention to joint finances, taxes, insurance, or inheritance-related themes. You may feel a stronger urge to understand what lies beneath the surface—both in situations and relationships. Authority dynamics can surface unexpectedly, pushing you to redefine control and trust. While progress may feel slow externally, this transit supports inner strength, resilience, and long-term restructuring if handled with clarity and patience.",
