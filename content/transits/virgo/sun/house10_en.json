  "title": "Sun Transit in the 10th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits your 10th house, career, authority, and public reputation take center stage. This is a visibility-driven phase where leadership, responsibility, and recognition increase. You may feel a strong urge to assert control, prove competence, or step into a decision-making role. Relations with bosses, government authorities, or senior figures become important. While this transit supports ambition and professional growth, ego clashes or misuse of authority can create resistance. Success depends on discipline, accountability, and ethical conduct.",
