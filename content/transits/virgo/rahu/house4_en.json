  "title": "Rahu in 4th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 4th house for Virgo Ascendant, inner stability, home life, and emotional security undergo disruption and redefinition. There is restlessness related to residence, property, or family peace. Desire for a better lifestyle, luxury, or relocation increases, but emotional satisfaction may feel unstable. Matters related to mother or domestic harmony need conscious handling. This transit pushes you to redefine what “security” means, but grounding and emotional discipline are essential to avoid anxiety and domestic imbalance.",
