  "title": "Rahu in 5th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 5th house for Virgo Ascendant, creativity, romance, intelligence, and decision-making become intense and unconventional. There is a strong urge to stand out through ideas, speculation, or performance. Attraction toward unusual relationships, risky investments, or shortcut-based success increases. Mental overactivity can distort judgment if discipline is missing. This phase supports innovation, strategic creativity, and competitive exams, but only when logic overrides impulse. Clear thinking and ethical restraint are essential to avoid losses in love, reputation, or speculation.",
