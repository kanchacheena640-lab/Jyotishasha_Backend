  "title": "Rahu in 7th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 7th house for Virgo Ascendant, partnerships, marriage, and public dealings become intense and unconventional. Attraction toward unusual or foreign partners increases, and expectations from relationships rise sharply. Business alliances may form quickly but need clear terms to avoid instability. Public image can fluctuate due to mixed signals or over-promising. This phase tests balance between self-interest and cooperation. Conscious boundaries, transparency, and realism are essential to prevent confusion, dependency, or repeated conflicts in partnerships.",
