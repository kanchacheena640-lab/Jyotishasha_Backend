  "title": "Rahu in 8th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 8th house for Virgo Ascendant, hidden matters, sudden changes, and psychological depth intensify. There is strong curiosity toward secrets, research, occult subjects, and power dynamics. Life can bring unexpected shifts in finances, health, or relationships, forcing internal transformation. Dependence on others’ resources may feel tempting but unstable. This phase rewards deep analysis, healing work, and risk awareness, while punishing secrecy, manipulation, or reckless exposure to danger. Awareness and discipline convert disruption into inner strength.",
