  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 6th house for Virgo Ascendant, competition, work pressure, health routines, and conflict management intensify. There is a strong drive to win over rivals, overcome obstacles, and prove competence through unconventional methods. You may thrive in competitive environments, litigation, or crisis-driven roles. However, stress, irregular habits, and obsession with control can affect health. This phase rewards discipline, strategic planning, and ethical conduct, while shortcuts or manipulative tactics can create hidden problems later.",
