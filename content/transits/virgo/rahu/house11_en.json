  "title": "Rahu in 11th House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 11th house for Virgo Ascendant, gains, ambitions, networks, and social influence expand rapidly. There is a strong hunger to achieve big goals, build powerful connections, and monetize influence through unconventional means. Friends, communities, and online platforms play a decisive role in opportunities and income. While sudden gains are possible, greed, overreach, or unreliable alliances can create reversals. This phase rewards strategic networking, ethical ambition, and clarity of long-term goals over impulsive chasing of status.",
