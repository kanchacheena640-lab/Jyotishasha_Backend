  "title": "Rahu in 2nd House for Virgo Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 2nd house for Virgo Ascendant, focus intensifies on money, speech, values, and family security. There is a strong urge to grow income quickly and redefine personal worth. Speech becomes influential but can turn sharp or manipulative if unchecked. Financial gains may come through unconventional sources, while instability arises from risk-taking or value confusion. This phase demands disciplined budgeting, ethical choices, and conscious communication to convert ambition into sustainable financial and emotional stability.",
