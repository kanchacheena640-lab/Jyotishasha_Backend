  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 10th house for Virgo Ascendant, career ambition, public image, and authority become highly intensified. There is a powerful desire for recognition, status, and rapid professional rise. Unconventional career paths, technology-driven roles, or foreign-linked opportunities gain prominence. Visibility increases, but pressure to perform can trigger shortcuts or image manipulation. This phase rewards strategic planning, ethical ambition, and long-term focus, while punishing impatience, reputation risks, or ego-driven decisions.",
