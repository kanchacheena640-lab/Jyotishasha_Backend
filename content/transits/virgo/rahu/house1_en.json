  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 1st house for Virgo Ascendant, identity, behavior, and self-projection undergo strong transformation. There is a heightened desire to stand out, experiment with image, and redefine personal direction. Ambition increases, but clarity can fluctuate, creating inner restlessness. You may appear unconventional, sharp, or unpredictable to others. This phase pushes self-reinvention, strategic thinking, and personal branding, but grounding is essential to avoid confusion, anxiety, or impulsive decisions driven by external validation.",
