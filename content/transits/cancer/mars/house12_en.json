  "title": "Mars Transit in the 12th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the twelfth house channels energy toward isolation, subconscious patterns, and behind-the-scenes efforts. For Cancer ascendants, this phase heightens inner restlessness and the need to release suppressed emotions. Actions may shift toward private work, foreign matters, or spiritual discipline. While productivity can rise in solitude, unexpressed anger or impulsive expenses may cause strain. This transit favors disciplined withdrawal, healing routines, and strategic planning away from the spotlight, provided energy is managed consciously and not wasted in conflict.",
