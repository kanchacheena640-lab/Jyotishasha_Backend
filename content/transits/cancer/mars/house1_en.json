  "title": "Mars Transit in the 1st House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the first house energizes your personality, willpower, and physical drive. For Cancer ascendants, this phase amplifies courage and initiative, pushing you to act decisively and assert your needs. Emotions run hotter, making reactions quicker and more direct. While confidence and leadership rise, impatience or irritability can surface if energy is not well-channeled. This transit favors bold starts, self-improvement, and taking charge, provided you balance action with emotional awareness and avoid unnecessary confrontations.",
