  "title": "Mars Transit in the 6th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the sixth house strengthens discipline, competitiveness, and the will to overcome obstacles. For Cancer ascendants, this phase heightens focus on work routines, health, and problem-solving. You become more determined to confront challenges directly and outperform rivals. While productivity increases, stress can rise if anger or overexertion is unchecked. This transit favors tackling debts, resolving disputes, and improving fitness through consistent effort. Channeling Mars into structured action brings victory through persistence rather than confrontation.",
