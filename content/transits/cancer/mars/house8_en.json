  "title": "Mars Transit in the 8th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the eighth house intensifies transformation, hidden matters, and emotional depth. For Cancer ascendants, this phase brings strong urges to confront fears, secrets, and unresolved issues head-on. Sudden changes may arise around shared resources, inheritances, or joint finances. While this transit fuels courage to face crises and research deeply, it can also trigger anxiety or power struggles if impatience dominates. This period favors healing, investigation, and strategic planning, provided actions are thoughtful and emotionally grounded.",
