  "title": "Mars Transit in the 4th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the fourth house activates domestic life, emotional security, and inner stability. For Cancer ascendants, this phase brings strong urges to take control of home-related matters, property decisions, or family responsibilities. Emotional intensity increases, making reactions at home quicker and sometimes confrontational. While this transit supports repairs, real estate actions, and decisive moves regarding residence, it also requires patience to maintain harmony. Channeling energy constructively helps strengthen foundations rather than disturb peace.",
