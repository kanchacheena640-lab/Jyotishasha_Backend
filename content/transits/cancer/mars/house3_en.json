  "title": "Mars Transit in the 3rd House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the third house sharpens courage, initiative, and communication. For Cancer ascendants, this phase fuels bold self-expression, quick decision-making, and a strong urge to take action through skills, writing, sales, or short travels. Efforts intensify, and results come through persistence. However, impatience with siblings or colleagues can surface if emotions override logic. This transit favors proactive learning, marketing, negotiations, and entrepreneurial moves, provided energy is directed constructively and unnecessary arguments are avoided.",
