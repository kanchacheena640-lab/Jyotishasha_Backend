  "summary": "Rahu transiting your third house activates bold communication, experimentation, and a strong urge to take initiative. Curiosity rises sharply, pushing you toward new skills, media, technology, or unconventional learning paths. Courage increases, but impatience and overconfidence can distort judgment. Sibling dynamics and close-network interactions may feel unpredictable. This transit favors self-made progress through smart risks, consistent effort, and disciplined follow-through rather than scattered action.",
