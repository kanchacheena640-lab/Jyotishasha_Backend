  "summary": "Rahu transiting your fourth house unsettles emotional security, home environment, and inner peace. There is a strong urge to change residence, upgrade lifestyle, or redefine what comfort means to you. Restlessness at home or distance from family roots may be felt. While material comforts attract attention, emotional satisfaction may fluctuate. This transit teaches you to separate true inner stability from external symbols of comfort, encouraging conscious choices around home, property, and emotional grounding.",
