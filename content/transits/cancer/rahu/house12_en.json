  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 12th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Rahu transiting your twelfth house draws attention toward isolation, hidden patterns, foreign connections, and subconscious fears. You may feel pulled toward solitude, overseas matters, or behind-the-scenes pursuits. Expenses can rise unexpectedly, especially around health, travel, or escapist habits, demanding conscious control. This transit blurs boundaries between reality and imagination, making grounding essential. When handled with awareness, Rahu here supports deep psychological release, spiritual exploration, and freedom from old limitations.",
