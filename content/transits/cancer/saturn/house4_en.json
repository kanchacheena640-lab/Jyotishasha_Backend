  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 4th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Saturn transiting your fourth house restructures emotional security, home life, and inner peace. This phase can feel heavy as domestic responsibilities, property matters, or parental duties increase. Comfort zones are challenged, pushing you to build stability through discipline rather than emotion. Emotional fulfillment may feel delayed, yet this transit strengthens your foundations from within. Over time, patience and responsibility create lasting inner security and a more mature relationship with home and family.",
