  "summary": "Saturn transiting your seventh house brings a serious, karmic phase to partnerships, marriage, and public dealings. Relationships are tested for commitment, responsibility, and realism. Superficial bonds weaken, while mature, long-term alliances gain strength. Delays or distance may appear, but they clarify expectations and boundaries. This transit teaches you patience in cooperation and fairness in agreements, helping you build partnerships that are stable, dependable, and resilient over time.",
