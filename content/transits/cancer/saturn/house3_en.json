  "summary": "Saturn transiting your third house restructures how you communicate, think, and take initiative. This phase tests courage, consistency, and effort. Results come only through sustained hard work rather than quick action. Relationships with siblings or close peers may feel distant or duty-bound. Mental stamina improves, but enthusiasm may feel muted initially. Saturn here builds long-term strength in skills, writing, learning, and disciplined effort, rewarding patience and persistence over impulsive moves.",
