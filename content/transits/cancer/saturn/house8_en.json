  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 8th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Saturn transiting your eighth house initiates a deep phase of transformation, emotional endurance, and karmic clearing. Sudden changes, shared resources, and hidden matters demand patience and responsibility. This transit can feel intense, bringing delays in joint finances or inheritance-related themes, yet it strengthens psychological resilience. Fear-based patterns surface for resolution, pushing you toward maturity and inner control. Over time, Saturn here builds lasting strength through acceptance, discipline, and profound inner restructuring.",
