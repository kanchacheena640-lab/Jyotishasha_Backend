  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 12th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Saturn transiting your twelfth house initiates a phase of withdrawal, closure, and deep inner restructuring. External progress may slow as focus shifts toward solitude, healing, and unfinished karmic matters. Expenses related to health, isolation, or responsibilities can increase, demanding disciplined management. This transit encourages detachment from old burdens and unconscious fears. Through patience and inner discipline, Saturn prepares you for a new cycle by strengthening spiritual resilience and emotional self-reliance.",
