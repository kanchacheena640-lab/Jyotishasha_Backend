  "summary": "Saturn transiting your first house brings a serious, grounding phase where self-image, health, and personal direction come under review. This is a period of slow but meaningful inner restructuring. You may feel more reserved, mature, or burdened by responsibility, yet this transit helps you build long-term stability. External recognition may feel delayed, but inner strength, discipline, and clarity grow steadily. How you carry yourself, make decisions, and respond to pressure now defines your future resilience.",
