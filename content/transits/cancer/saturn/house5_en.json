  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 5th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Saturn transiting your fifth house brings a serious tone to creativity, romance, children, and self-expression. Pleasure-driven pursuits slow down, making space for discipline and responsibility. Romantic matters may feel tested, pushing you to seek depth over excitement. Creative output improves through structure and patience rather than spontaneity. This phase may delay gratification, but it strengthens commitment, maturity, and long-term fulfillment in love, learning, and personal talents.",
