  "summary": "Saturn transiting your second house shifts focus toward finances, family responsibilities, speech, and core values. This phase demands discipline in money matters and maturity in communication. Income may grow slowly, but stability becomes the priority. Family obligations can feel heavy, yet they strengthen your sense of duty. Saturn teaches you to value what is earned through patience, restraint, and consistency, helping you build long-term security rather than short-lived comfort.",
