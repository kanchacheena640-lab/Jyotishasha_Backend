  "title": "Venus Transit in the 11th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Venus transiting the eleventh house enhances social harmony, gains, and fulfillment of aspirations. For Cancer ascendants, this phase supports income growth through networks, friendships, and collaborative efforts. Popularity increases, and support from allies feels natural when values align. Creative or relationship-driven goals progress smoothly. However, over-reliance on social approval or mixing finances with friendships can complicate outcomes. This transit favors value-based networking, clear expectations, and balanced generosity to convert connections into sustainable achievements.",
