  "title": "Venus Transit in the 8th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Venus transiting the eighth house deepens emotional intimacy, shared resources, and transformational bonds. For Cancer ascendants, this phase brings heightened sensitivity in close relationships and a stronger focus on trust, transparency, and emotional merging. Attraction intensifies, but so do expectations around loyalty and fairness. Joint finances, inheritances, or benefits through partners may come into focus, requiring clarity and balance. This transit favors honest intimacy, mature handling of shared assets, and emotional healing that strengthens bonds rather than creating dependency.",
