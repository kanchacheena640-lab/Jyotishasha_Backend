  "summary": "Venus transiting the twelfth house emphasizes solitude, compassion, and subtle pleasures. For Cancer ascendants, this phase draws attention to emotional healing, rest, and behind-the-scenes support. Spending may increase on comforts, travel, or spiritual pursuits, making conscious boundaries important. Relationships benefit from empathy and forgiveness, though secrecy or unrealistic expectations can drain energy. This transit favors quiet creativity, charitable actions, and inner balance, helping you reconnect with peace and emotional clarity away from public demands.",
