  "title": "Venus Transit in the 4th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Venus transiting the fourth house enhances emotional comfort, domestic harmony, and inner contentment. For Cancer ascendants, this phase brings warmth into home life, improves relationships with family members, and increases appreciation for beauty and peace in personal spaces. Property, vehicles, and home-related comforts gain attention. Emotional security grows through nurturing environments, though excessive attachment to comfort can reduce initiative. This transit favors beautifying the home, strengthening emotional roots, and cultivating inner balance without becoming overly dependent on familiarity.",
