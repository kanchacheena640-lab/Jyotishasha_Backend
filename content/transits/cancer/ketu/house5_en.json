  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 5th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your fifth house creates detachment from validation through creativity, romance, and recognition. You may feel less motivated to seek attention for talents or intellectual achievements, preferring quiet depth over display. Romantic expression becomes restrained, and emotional excitement reduces. This phase encourages maturity in decision-making, especially around speculation or expectations. When accepted consciously, Ketu here refines intelligence, removes ego from creativity, and supports wisdom rooted in inner clarity.",
