  "summary": "Ketu transiting your sixth house brings detachment from conflict, competition, and constant problem-solving. You may feel less interested in proving yourself through struggle or comparison, preferring quiet efficiency instead. Health awareness increases, but symptoms can feel vague or psychosomatic if ignored. This phase supports releasing old habits, debts, and mental burdens. When approached consciously, Ketu here helps you rise above enemies, stress, and routines by simplifying life and acting with inner discipline.",
