  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 9th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your ninth house brings detachment from rigid belief systems, external guidance, and inherited philosophies. You may question teachers, traditions, or long-held principles, seeking truth through personal experience rather than doctrine. Travel for meaning may reduce, while inner exploration increases. This phase reshapes faith into something quieter and self-realized. When embraced consciously, Ketu here deepens spiritual maturity, removes blind belief, and aligns you with a more authentic inner compass.",
