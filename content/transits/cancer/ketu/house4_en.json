  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 4th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your fourth house brings detachment from emotional security, home comforts, and familiar attachments. You may feel inwardly distant even while surrounded by family or material support. Changes related to residence, property, or inner peace can arise quietly. This phase reduces dependence on external comfort and pushes you to find stability within. When accepted consciously, Ketu here deepens emotional maturity and creates a calm, self-contained inner foundation.",
