  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 2nd House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your second house brings detachment from material security, family conditioning, and habitual speech patterns. You may feel less motivated by wealth accumulation and more inclined toward minimalism or value-based living. Family interactions can feel distant or emotionally muted. Speech becomes restrained, sometimes blunt or unusually silent. This transit teaches you to redefine self-worth beyond money and possessions, cultivating inner stability while simplifying financial and emotional dependencies.",
