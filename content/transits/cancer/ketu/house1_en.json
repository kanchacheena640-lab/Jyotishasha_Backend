  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 1st House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your first house creates a phase of detachment from identity, ego, and external validation. You may feel less interested in self-promotion and more drawn toward inner clarity and simplicity. Confidence turns inward, sometimes appearing as withdrawal or emotional distance to others. This transit dissolves outdated self-images and pushes you to understand who you are beyond roles and labels. When accepted consciously, it supports deep self-awareness and inner stability.",
