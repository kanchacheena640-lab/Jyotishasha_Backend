  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 11th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your eleventh house brings detachment from social validation, large networks, and outcome-driven desires. Goals that were once motivating may lose emotional pull, prompting a reassessment of what truly feels meaningful. Associations with groups or friends may thin out naturally, favoring quality over quantity. Gains arrive quietly or feel less satisfying than expected. When embraced consciously, Ketu here refines aspirations, reduces dependency on approval, and aligns long-term hopes with inner truth.",
