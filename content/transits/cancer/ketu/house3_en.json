  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 3rd House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your third house brings detachment from excessive communication, constant movement, and the need for external validation through effort. Motivation to prove yourself may feel reduced, yet inner courage develops quietly. Interactions with siblings or close contacts can become distant or minimal. This phase favors selective action, depth over noise, and skill refinement without display. When embraced consciously, Ketu here strengthens inner confidence and purposeful communication.",
