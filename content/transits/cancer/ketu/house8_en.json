  "summary": "Ketu transiting your eighth house intensifies detachment from control, secrecy, and emotional dependency. Sudden inner shifts may occur, pushing you toward deeper self-awareness and psychological release. Interest in hidden matters, research, or spiritual knowledge can increase, while material security feels secondary. This phase dissolves fear around loss and transformation. When handled consciously, Ketu here supports profound inner cleansing, reduced anxiety about uncertainty, and a calmer relationship with change.",
