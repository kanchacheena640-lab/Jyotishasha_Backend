  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 12th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting your twelfth house intensifies detachment from the material world, outcomes, and visible control over life. The need for isolation, rest, or withdrawal increases as inner awareness deepens. Expenses may rise on spiritual, healing, or non-material matters, while worldly ambition fades. This phase dissolves subconscious fears and old karmic residue. When embraced consciously, Ketu here supports deep inner cleansing, spiritual surrender, and liberation from hidden anxieties.",
