  "summary": "Ketu transiting your tenth house brings detachment from status, recognition, and conventional definitions of success. Career motivation may feel muted, especially toward authority-driven roles or public validation. You may prefer working quietly without seeking acknowledgment. This phase questions ambition rooted in image and pushes you to redefine purpose beyond titles. When handled consciously, Ketu here supports integrity-driven work, reduces ego in leadership, and aligns professional life with inner values.",
