  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 6th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Jupiter transiting the sixth house expands focus on service, discipline, and problem-solving. For Cancer ascendants, this phase supports growth through responsibility, ethical work habits, and steady improvement in daily routines. Challenges become manageable through wisdom rather than force, and conflicts resolve with fair judgment. Health matters benefit from informed choices and consistency. However, excess optimism about workload or health can delay action. This transit favors structured effort, service-oriented leadership, and patient perseverance to convert duties into lasting gains.",
