  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 4th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Jupiter transiting the fourth house expands emotional security, domestic stability, and inner peace. For Cancer ascendants, this phase supports harmony at home, stronger bonds with family, and a deepening sense of belonging. Matters related to property, education, and long-term emotional foundations receive positive momentum. Guidance from elders or mentors proves helpful. While comfort and optimism increase, overindulgence or emotional complacency can slow growth. This transit favors nurturing environments, value-based decisions, and steady inner expansion.",
