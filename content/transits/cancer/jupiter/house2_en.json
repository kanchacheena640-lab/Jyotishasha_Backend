  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 2nd House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Jupiter transiting the second house expands focus on wealth, values, and family stability. For Cancer ascendants, this phase supports gradual financial growth, wiser money management, and a more generous yet ethical approach to resources. Speech becomes influential, often reflecting optimism and guidance, strengthening family bonds. Long-term savings and value-based decisions bring security. However, indulgence or overconfidence in spending can dilute gains. This transit favors disciplined growth, respectful communication, and alignment of finances with core principles.",
