  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 8th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Jupiter transiting the eighth house expands awareness around transformation, shared resources, and inner resilience. For Cancer ascendants, this phase encourages deeper understanding of emotional patterns, joint finances, and long-term security matters. Support may come through inheritances, insurance, or advisory guidance, provided decisions remain ethical and patient. Psychological growth and healing accelerate when wisdom is applied to change. However, overreliance on external support or blind optimism can create delays. This transit favors disciplined transformation, research, and trust built on transparency.",
