  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 12th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Jupiter transiting the twelfth house expands spiritual awareness, compassion, and inner release. For Cancer ascendants, this phase encourages reflection, healing, and growth through letting go of past burdens. Expenses may rise toward travel, charity, education, or inner development, yielding subtle long-term benefits. Solitude and foreign connections support insight when approached consciously. However, unchecked generosity or escapism can drain resources. This transit favors mindful withdrawal, disciplined spirituality, and purposeful compassion to transform endings into quiet preparation for a new cycle.",
