  "title": "Sun Transit in the 12th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting the twelfth house turns focus inward, reducing interest in external recognition and pushing attention toward rest, reflection, and closure. Energy may feel lower, and expenses can rise on travel, health, or behind-the-scenes matters. This phase favors spiritual work, planning, and release of ego-driven goals. Avoid isolation by maintaining gentle routines.",
