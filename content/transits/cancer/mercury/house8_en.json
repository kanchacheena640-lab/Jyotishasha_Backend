  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 8th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting the eighth house sharpens thinking around hidden matters, transformation, and shared resources. For Cancer ascendants, this phase draws the mind toward research, investigation, and understanding emotional or financial complexities. Conversations may turn private or intense, focusing on trust, secrets, or joint responsibilities. While this transit supports deep analysis, healing work, and strategic planning, excessive mental probing can increase anxiety. Balanced inquiry and clear communication help convert insight into empowerment rather than worry.",
