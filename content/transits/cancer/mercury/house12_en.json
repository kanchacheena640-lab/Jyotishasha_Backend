  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 12th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting the twelfth house turns thinking inward toward reflection, solitude, and subconscious processing. For Cancer ascendants, this phase heightens mental sensitivity and draws attention to private matters, rest, and behind-the-scenes planning. Communication becomes subtle, with benefits from research, writing in isolation, or foreign connections. While insight deepens, excessive rumination or mental withdrawal can reduce clarity. This transit favors quiet analysis, spiritual study, and conscious rest, allowing the mind to reset and prepare for the next outward cycle.",
