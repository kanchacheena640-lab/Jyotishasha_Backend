  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 9th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting the ninth house expands thinking toward higher knowledge, beliefs, and long-term vision. For Cancer ascendants, this phase sharpens intellectual curiosity around philosophy, education, law, and travel. You become more articulate about ideals and eager to learn from mentors or new experiences. While logic helps refine beliefs, excessive debate or mental rigidity can create friction. This transit favors study, teaching, publishing, and purposeful travel when openness and humility guide communication.",
