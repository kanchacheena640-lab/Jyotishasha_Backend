  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 1st House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting the first house sharpens intellect, communication, and self-expression. For Cancer ascendants, this phase brings mental alertness and a stronger need to articulate thoughts clearly. You become more curious, adaptable, and responsive in interactions, with a visible shift toward reasoning over emotion. Decisions are quicker, conversations increase, and learning accelerates. However, overthinking or nervousness can surface if the mind is overstimulated. This transit favors personal branding, study, writing, and negotiations when balanced with emotional grounding.",
