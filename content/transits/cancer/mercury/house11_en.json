  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 11th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting the eleventh house amplifies networking, goal-setting, and intellectual exchange within groups. For Cancer ascendants, this phase sharpens strategic thinking around gains, collaborations, and future plans. Communication with friends, teams, and professional networks becomes frequent and purposeful. Ideas circulate quickly, opening doors through discussions, referrals, and shared knowledge. While this transit supports gains through communication, scattered goals or overtalking can dilute results. Focused dialogue and clear priorities turn connections into measurable progress.",
