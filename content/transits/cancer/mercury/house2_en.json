  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 2nd House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting the second house highlights speech, finances, and personal values. For Cancer ascendants, this phase sharpens financial thinking and brings a practical approach to earnings, savings, and resource management. Communication within family matters becomes more frequent and logic-driven. Income opportunities may arise through communication, trade, or advisory roles. However, overanalysis of money or sharp words can disturb harmony. This transit favors budgeting, financial planning, and mindful speech, ensuring clarity supports stability rather than tension.",
