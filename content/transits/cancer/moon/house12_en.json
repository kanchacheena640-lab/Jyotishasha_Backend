  "title": "Moon Transit in the 12th House for Cancer Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Moon transiting the twelfth house draws emotions inward, increasing sensitivity, solitude, and subconscious processing. You may feel the need to withdraw, rest, or reflect, with heightened intuition and vivid dreams. Expenses can rise quietly, especially on comfort, travel, or healing. This phase supports emotional release and closure, provided isolation does not turn into avoidance.",
