  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 12th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Rahu transiting the 12th house for Taurus Ascendant heightens themes of isolation, hidden fears, foreign connections, and subconscious patterns. Expenses may rise unexpectedly, often linked to travel, health, or intangible pursuits. Sleep and mental peace can feel disturbed as suppressed anxieties surface. This phase pulls attention away from visibility toward inner worlds, secrecy, and behind-the-scenes activity. When approached with discipline and awareness, Rahu supports deep psychological cleansing, spiritual exploration, and release of self-sabotaging habits that block long-term stability.",
