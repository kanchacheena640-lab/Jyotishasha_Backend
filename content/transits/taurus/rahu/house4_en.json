  "summary": "Rahu transiting the 4th house for Taurus Ascendant unsettles emotional foundations, home dynamics, and inner security. This phase brings restlessness at home, shifting living conditions, or unusual domestic decisions. Emotional satisfaction may feel inconsistent, pushing a redefinition of comfort and belonging. Property matters can involve unconventional choices or sudden changes. Relationship with the mother requires sensitivity. When managed consciously, Rahu helps detach from outdated emotional patterns and create a new sense of inner stability aligned with evolving life needs.",
