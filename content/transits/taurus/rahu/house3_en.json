  "summary": "Rahu transiting the 3rd house for Taurus Ascendant activates intense focus on communication, self-effort, and personal courage. This phase encourages bold initiatives, unconventional ideas, and strategic risk-taking. Mental restlessness increases, pushing experimentation in skills, media, and short-term ventures. Relationships with siblings and peers may feel competitive or unpredictable. Success comes through smart planning rather than impulsive action. When channelled consciously, Rahu strengthens persuasive power, adaptability, and the ability to turn calculated effort into visible momentum.",
