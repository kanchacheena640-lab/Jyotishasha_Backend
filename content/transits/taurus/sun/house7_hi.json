  "title": "Sun Transit in the 7th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your 7th house shifts focus toward partnerships, marriage, and public interactions. This phase highlights authority dynamics within one-to-one relationships, increasing the desire to lead or be recognized through associations. Business partnerships and negotiations gain prominence, but ego clashes or dominance issues may surface if balance is ignored. You may expect respect and visibility through partners, while learning lessons around equality and cooperation. Conscious adjustment helps transform assertiveness into mutual growth rather than relational strain.",
