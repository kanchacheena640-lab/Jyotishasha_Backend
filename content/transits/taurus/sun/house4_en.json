  "title": "Sun Transit in the 4th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your 4th house shifts focus toward home, emotional foundations, and inner security. This phase highlights responsibility within domestic matters and a desire to lead or reorganize the home environment. Pride in family roots increases, though authority dynamics with parents—especially the mother—may surface. While the need for comfort and stability grows, inner restlessness can arise if emotional needs are unmet. Balanced leadership at home strengthens peace, grounding confidence without dominating personal spaces.",
