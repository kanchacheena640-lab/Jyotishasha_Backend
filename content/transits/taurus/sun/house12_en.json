  "title": "Sun Transit in the 12th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your 12th house shifts focus toward introspection, withdrawal, and behind-the-scenes responsibilities. This phase highlights the need to conserve energy, manage expenses, and work quietly without immediate recognition. You may feel drawn to solitude, spiritual reflection, or roles that require discretion. While inner awareness deepens, visibility in external matters may reduce, leading to frustration if expectations remain high. Acceptance of this inward phase helps restore clarity, strengthen inner authority, and prepare for renewed outward expression.",
