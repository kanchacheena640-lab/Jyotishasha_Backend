  "title": "Sun Transit in the 2nd House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your 2nd house highlights themes of wealth, values, family responsibility, and self-worth. This phase strengthens the desire to secure financial stability through personal effort and authority. Speech becomes firm and impactful, though occasionally rigid. Focus shifts toward income, savings, and recognition for your contribution to family or resources. While confidence around finances improves, ego clashes over money or values are possible. Balanced communication and disciplined planning ensure that authority translates into lasting security.",
