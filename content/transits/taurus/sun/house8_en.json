  "title": "Sun Transit in the 8th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your 8th house activates transformation, shared resources, and deeper psychological awareness. This phase brings focus to joint finances, taxes, inheritances, and matters requiring discretion. You may feel compelled to understand hidden dynamics and assert control over uncertain situations. While resilience strengthens, power struggles or stress around shared obligations can surface. Managing intensity with transparency and patience helps convert pressure into strategic insight and long-term stability.",
