  "title": "Sun Transit in the 1st House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your 1st house heightens self-awareness, vitality, and personal authority. This phase strengthens presence and visibility, prompting you to assert identity with confidence and clarity. Leadership tendencies rise, and decisions are driven by self-belief rather than external approval. While motivation and stamina improve, ego sensitivity can surface if recognition is delayed. The Sun here asks for balanced self-expression—projecting strength without rigidity—so confidence translates into constructive action and authentic influence.",
