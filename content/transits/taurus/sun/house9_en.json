  "title": "Sun Transit in the 9th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your 9th house emphasizes belief systems, higher learning, ethics, and long-term direction. This phase strengthens the urge to define personal philosophy through experience, travel, or guidance roles. Respect for mentors and traditions increases, though rigid opinions can surface if ego dominates beliefs. You may seek recognition through teaching, advising, or principled leadership. When humility balances conviction, this transit supports clarity of purpose and alignment with broader life principles.",
