  "title": "Sun Transit in the 11th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your 11th house activates goals, gains, networks, and social influence. This phase strengthens ambition toward long-term objectives and brings visibility through associations, teams, or leadership roles within groups. You may seek recognition for contributions and feel motivated to expand professional or social circles. While opportunities for gains increase, ego dynamics within networks can create friction if dominance overrides collaboration. Purposeful engagement and respect for collective effort help translate visibility into sustainable progress and meaningful support.",
