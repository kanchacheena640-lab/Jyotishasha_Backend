  "title": "Moon Transit in the 8th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Moon transiting your 8th house intensifies emotional depth, inner transformation, and sensitivity around shared matters. This phase heightens awareness of trust, intimacy, and psychological undercurrents, often bringing buried feelings to the surface. Concerns related to joint finances, obligations, or uncertainty can affect mood. While intuition becomes sharper, emotional reactions may feel heavier if boundaries are unclear. Grounded reflection and honest communication help convert emotional intensity into resilience, insight, and constructive inner change.",
