  "title": "Moon Transit in the 6th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Moon transiting your 6th house brings emotional focus to work routines, health matters, and daily responsibilities. This phase heightens sensitivity toward stress, competition, and service-oriented roles. You may feel emotionally involved in solving problems or supporting others, though mood fluctuations can affect efficiency. Health responses become closely linked to emotional state, making balance essential. When emotions are managed constructively, this transit supports adaptability, compassionate service, and practical problem-solving without mental strain or burnout.",
