  "title": "Moon Transit in the 4th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Moon transiting your 4th house heightens emotional attachment to home, family, and inner security. This phase draws attention inward, increasing the need for comfort, familiarity, and emotional reassurance. Domestic matters and parental connections, especially with the mother, become more prominent and emotionally charged. While the desire for peace and stability strengthens, mood fluctuations can disturb inner calm if boundaries are unclear. Nurturing routines and emotional awareness help restore balance and create a supportive inner foundation.",
