  "title": "Moon Transit in the 12th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Moon transiting your 12th house shifts emotional focus inward, increasing sensitivity to rest, solitude, and subconscious patterns. This phase heightens emotional awareness of losses, closures, and behind-the-scenes matters, often creating a need for privacy and reflection. Sleep patterns and emotional health are closely linked, making rest essential. Compassion toward others increases, but emotional drain is possible without boundaries. When grounded through mindful routines, this transit supports inner healing, emotional release, and quiet psychological renewal.",
