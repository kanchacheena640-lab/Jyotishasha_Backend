  "title": "Moon Transit in the 2nd House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Moon transiting your 2nd house brings emotional focus to finances, values, and family support. This phase heightens sensitivity around income, savings, and material security, making you more responsive to fluctuations in resources. Speech becomes emotionally colored, influencing how your words are received. Comfort is closely tied to financial and familial stability, and spending decisions may be mood-driven. Grounded planning and mindful communication help maintain balance, allowing emotional intelligence to support security rather than disrupt it.",
