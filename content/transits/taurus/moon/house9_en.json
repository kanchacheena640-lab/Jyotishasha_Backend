  "summary": "The Moon transiting your 9th house brings emotional focus to beliefs, guidance, and long-term meaning. This phase heightens sensitivity toward faith, ethics, and life direction, often prompting reflection on purpose and personal philosophy. Emotional connection with mentors, teachers, or guiding figures becomes significant. Travel or learning experiences may feel deeply impactful. While intuition around beliefs strengthens, mood-driven opinions can fluctuate. Grounded reflection helps align emotions with wisdom, supporting clarity, faith, and balanced outlook.",
