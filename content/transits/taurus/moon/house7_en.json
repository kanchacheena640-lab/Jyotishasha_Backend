  "title": "Moon Transit in the 7th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Moon transiting your 7th house heightens emotional sensitivity within partnerships, marriage, and one-to-one interactions. This phase increases the need for emotional connection, reassurance, and responsiveness from others. Relationships strongly influence mood, making cooperation and mutual understanding essential. You may become more aware of your partner’s feelings, but emotional dependence or fluctuating expectations can create imbalance. When emotions are expressed calmly and boundaries remain clear, this transit supports nurturing partnerships and harmonious collaborations.",
