  "summary": "Venus transiting the 4th house enhances emotional comfort, domestic harmony, and attachment to home and inner security for Taurus Ascendant. This phase supports peaceful family interactions, aesthetic improvements in living spaces, and a stronger need for emotional reassurance. Property-related discussions and matters of convenience progress smoothly when handled with sensitivity. However, emotional dependence or indulgence in comfort can reduce motivation. When balance is maintained, this transit nurtures inner stability, supportive relationships, and a refined sense of belonging.",
