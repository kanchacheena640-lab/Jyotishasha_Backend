  "title": "Venus Transit in the 12th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Venus transiting the 12th house turns attention toward inner emotions, privacy, compassion, and subtle pleasures for Taurus Ascendant. This phase increases attraction to solitude, spiritual comfort, and behind-the-scenes relationships or creative pursuits. Expenses may rise on luxury, travel, healing, or emotional gratification, requiring conscious control. Emotional sensitivity deepens, making boundaries essential. When awareness guides desire, this transit supports spiritual refinement, emotional release, and graceful detachment from excess attachment.",
