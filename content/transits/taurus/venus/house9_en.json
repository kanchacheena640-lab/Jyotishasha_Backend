  "summary": "Venus transiting the 9th house refines belief systems, higher learning, long-distance travel, and ethical outlook for Taurus Ascendant. This phase supports pleasant learning experiences, attraction toward philosophy, culture, and meaningful journeys. Relationships with mentors or guides become cordial, and values align more gracefully with principles. However, idealizing beliefs or avoiding practical application can reduce growth. When values are lived with discipline, this transit enhances wisdom, cultural enrichment, and balanced expansion of perspective.",
