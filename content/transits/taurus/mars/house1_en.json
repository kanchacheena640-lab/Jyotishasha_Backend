  "title": "Mars Transit in the 1st House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting your 1st house activates drive, assertiveness, and physical vitality, making your presence more forceful and action-oriented. This phase increases courage and initiative, pushing you to take the lead and assert personal priorities. However, impatience and impulsive reactions can rise if energy is not directed consciously. Physical stamina improves, but stress may manifest quickly. When actions are guided with discipline and restraint, this transit supports confident self-expression, decisive action, and constructive leadership.",
