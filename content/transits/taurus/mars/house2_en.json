  "title": "Mars Transit in the 2nd House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting your 2nd house energizes matters of speech, finances, and personal values. This phase sharpens assertiveness in communication and decision-making related to money, often pushing you to act decisively about resources. While motivation to increase income strengthens, impatience or harsh expression can create friction within family or financial discussions. Spending impulses may rise under emotional pressure. When discipline guides actions and words are chosen carefully, this transit supports financial initiative, value-driven effort, and confident self-worth.",
