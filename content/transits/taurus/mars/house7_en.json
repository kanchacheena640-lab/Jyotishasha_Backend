  "title": "Mars Transit in the 7th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the 7th house intensifies interactions within partnerships, marriage, and public dealings. This period brings assertiveness and directness in one-to-one relationships, often increasing passion as well as conflict. Business partnerships become dynamic but demand careful handling to avoid dominance struggles. You may feel compelled to assert your position strongly, which can strain harmony if not balanced with patience. When consciously managed, this transit supports decisive negotiations, courageous commitments, and the ability to confront relationship challenges head-on.",
