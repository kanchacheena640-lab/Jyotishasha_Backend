  "title": "Mars Transit in the 3rd House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting your 3rd house activates courage, communication, and decisive action in daily efforts. This phase strengthens initiative in learning, writing, sales, and short-term goals, making you more outspoken and bold in expressing ideas. Interactions with siblings or close contacts become more direct and energetic. While confidence in self-effort rises, impatience or sharp words can create friction. When energy is channelled through disciplined action and thoughtful communication, this transit supports skill development, assertive networking, and productive momentum.",
