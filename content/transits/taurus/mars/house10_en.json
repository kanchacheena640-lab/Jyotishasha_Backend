  "title": "Mars Transit in the 10th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the 10th house strongly activates career, authority, and public reputation. This is a highly visible and action-driven phase where ambition rises and the urge to lead, perform, and achieve tangible results becomes dominant. Professional responsibilities increase, pushing you to take bold decisions and assert control in your role. While this transit supports rapid progress and recognition through effort, impatience or clashes with seniors can damage standing. Disciplined action and strategic restraint are essential for long-term success.",
