  "title": "Mars Transit in the 12th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting the 12th house redirects energy toward isolation, expenses, foreign matters, and subconscious patterns. This phase can increase behind-the-scenes effort, pushing you to work in seclusion or deal with hidden challenges. Expenditures may rise due to travel, health, or unresolved obligations, while suppressed anger can surface if not managed consciously. Spiritual practices and disciplined routines help channel intensity constructively. When guided with awareness, this transit supports inner strength, strategic withdrawal, and purposeful action away from public visibility.",
