  "summary": "Mercury transiting the 3rd house energizes communication, courage, learning, and everyday interactions. This phase sharpens your ability to express ideas, negotiate effectively, and take initiative in short-term efforts. Writing, marketing, sales, and skill-based activities gain momentum, while interactions with siblings and peers become frequent. Mental agility supports multitasking, though restlessness or scattered focus can reduce efficiency. When structured with discipline, this transit strengthens confidence, practical intelligence, and success through consistent effort.",
