  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 12th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting the 12th house redirects mental energy toward introspection, isolation, foreign matters, and hidden expenses. Thinking becomes private and reflective, supporting research, planning, and behind-the-scenes work. Communication may reduce outwardly while internal analysis deepens. Expenses linked to travel, health, or documentation can rise if details are ignored. Overthinking can disturb sleep or peace of mind. When managed with structure, this transit supports strategic withdrawal, spiritual study, and quiet progress without unnecessary exposure.",
