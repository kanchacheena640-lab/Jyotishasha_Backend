  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 10th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting the 10th house sharpens professional communication, strategic thinking, and public decision-making. This phase highlights planning, negotiations, and documentation in career matters, increasing visibility through intellect rather than force. Authority figures notice clarity of ideas, while multitasking and meetings increase. However, overanalysis or frequent opinion shifts can weaken credibility. When guided with consistency, this transit supports career growth through smart execution, clear messaging, and reputation built on competence and reliability.",
