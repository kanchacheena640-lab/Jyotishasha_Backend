  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 9th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting the 9th house activates higher learning, belief systems, long-distance travel, and ethical decision-making. This phase sharpens intellectual curiosity toward philosophy, law, spirituality, and advanced studies. Communication with mentors, teachers, or guides increases, though excessive questioning can create friction. Travel plans become learning-oriented rather than leisurely. When thinking remains open and disciplined, this transit supports clear judgment, informed guidance, and purposeful expansion aligned with personal principles.",
