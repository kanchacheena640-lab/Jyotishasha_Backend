  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 4th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting the 4th house turns attention toward home, emotional security, property matters, and inner peace. This phase encourages practical discussions within the family and thoughtful decisions related to residence, vehicles, or real estate. Mental focus shifts inward, supporting study, planning, and work-from-home activities. However, overthinking domestic issues or emotional detachment can disturb harmony. When communication remains clear and considerate, this transit supports intellectual stability, organized domestic life, and balanced emotional grounding.",
