  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 8th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting the 8th house shifts mental focus toward hidden matters, joint finances, research, and psychological depth. This phase sharpens analytical ability to understand complex issues such as taxes, debts, inheritance, and shared resources. Curiosity about secrets, healing, or occult subjects increases. Communication may become guarded or strategic. Overthinking sensitive matters can cause anxiety, but when guided with clarity, this transit supports deep insight, effective crisis management, and intelligent handling of transformative situations.",
