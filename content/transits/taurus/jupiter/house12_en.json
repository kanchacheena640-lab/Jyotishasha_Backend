  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 12th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Jupiter transiting the 12th house expands inner awareness, spiritual orientation, foreign connections, and charitable tendencies. This phase encourages introspection, learning through solitude, and growth beyond material frameworks. Expenses may rise on education, travel, health, or spiritual pursuits, requiring conscious management. Support can come from distant places or unseen sources. However, escapism or excessive idealism can weaken focus. When discipline anchors faith, this transit supports inner growth, compassionate action, and meaningful closure of karmic patterns.",
