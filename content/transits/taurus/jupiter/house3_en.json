  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 3rd House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Jupiter transiting the 3rd house expands courage, communication, learning, and self-effort. This phase encourages confidence in expressing ideas, taking initiative, and developing skills through consistent practice. Interactions with siblings, peers, and networks become supportive, often opening doors through guidance or shared knowledge. Writing, teaching, marketing, and short travels gain purpose. While optimism fuels action, complacency or overpromising can dilute results. When effort remains disciplined, this transit supports steady progress through informed initiative.",
