  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 10th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Jupiter transiting the 10th house expands professional responsibility, authority, and long-term career direction. This phase supports ethical leadership, recognition through merit, and growth in roles that require guidance or decision-making. Public image improves when actions align with principles. Opportunities arise through mentors, institutions, or senior figures. However, overconfidence or reliance on status without effort can slow results. When ambition is matched with discipline, this transit strengthens reputation, stability, and purpose-driven professional progress.",
