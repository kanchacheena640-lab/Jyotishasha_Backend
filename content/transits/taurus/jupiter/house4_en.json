  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 4th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Jupiter transiting the 4th house expands themes of emotional security, home, education, property, and inner stability. This phase supports harmony within the family, constructive guidance from elders, and wise decisions related to residence, land, or vehicles. Learning deepens in a calm environment, and moral grounding strengthens inner peace. However, overindulgence or complacency at home can reduce discipline. When balanced with responsibility, this transit nurtures stable foundations, supportive domestic bonds, and lasting emotional fulfillment.",
