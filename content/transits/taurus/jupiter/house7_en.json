  "summary": "Jupiter transiting the 7th house expands focus on marriage, partnerships, contracts, and public dealings. This phase supports growth through ethical alliances, mature relationship choices, and fair negotiations. Guidance from mentors or experienced partners becomes valuable, and long-term commitments gain stability. However, excessive expectations or idealism toward others can create imbalance.
