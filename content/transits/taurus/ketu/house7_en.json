  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 7th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 7th house for Taurus Ascendant brings detachment and reassessment in partnerships, marriage, and public dealings. Expectations from others reduce, creating emotional distance or silence in close relationships. Business alliances may feel misaligned unless purpose and boundaries are clearly defined. There is a tendency to withdraw from negotiation or compromise. This transit exposes dependency patterns and karmic ties within relationships. When handled consciously, Ketu supports clarity, mature boundaries, and partnerships based on truth rather than attachment.",
