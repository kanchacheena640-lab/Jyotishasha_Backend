  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 12th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 12th house for Taurus Ascendant strongly amplifies detachment, isolation, and inner withdrawal. Desire for material enjoyment, visibility, and external engagement reduces, while introspection and solitude increase. Sleep patterns may fluctuate, and subconscious themes surface for release. Expenses may rise quietly, often toward spiritual, medical, or charitable matters rather than indulgence. This transit dissolves hidden attachments and past karmic residues. When handled consciously, Ketu supports liberation, spiritual clarity, and deep inner peace beyond worldly identification.",
