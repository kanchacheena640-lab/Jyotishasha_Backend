  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 4th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 4th house for Taurus Ascendant creates emotional detachment from home, comfort, and familiar security patterns. Inner contentment feels elusive, pushing a quiet withdrawal from domestic involvement. Living situations may feel temporary or unsettled, not due to conflict but inner disinterest. Connection with the mother can become distant or duty-bound. This transit redirects focus from external comfort to inner stability. When accepted consciously, Ketu refines emotional dependence and cultivates self-sufficiency rooted in inner peace.",
