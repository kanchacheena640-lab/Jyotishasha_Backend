  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 3rd House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 3rd house for Taurus Ascendant reduces attachment to self-effort, communication, and constant engagement with surroundings. Motivation to prove courage or initiative externally weakens, while actions become selective and purpose-driven. Communication turns minimal, inward, or highly factual, sometimes creating distance with siblings or peers. Short travels lose appeal unless necessary. This transit refines effort by eliminating noise and impulsiveness. When used consciously, Ketu strengthens inner courage, focused skill application, and disciplined action without ego-driven display.",
