  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 1st House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 1st house for Taurus Ascendant initiates a phase of detachment from identity, appearance, and personal validation. Self-image becomes fluid, reducing interest in projection and external approval. Confidence may feel muted, yet inner awareness deepens. Health sensitivity increases, especially when mental disengagement affects vitality. This transit pushes introspection, simplicity, and karmic correction of ego patterns. When consciously integrated, Ketu supports inner clarity, spiritual maturity, and freedom from compulsive self-definition.",
