  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 10th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 10th house for Taurus Ascendant brings detachment from status, authority, and public recognition. Career motivation shifts inward, reducing interest in titles, hierarchy, or external validation. Work may feel mechanical unless aligned with deeper purpose, leading to periods of withdrawal or role reassessment. Relations with superiors can feel distant or misaligned. This transit exposes ambition driven by ego and redirects effort toward meaningful contribution. When handled consciously, Ketu supports ethical work, quiet mastery, and purpose-led professional realignment.",
