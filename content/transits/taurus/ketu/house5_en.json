  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 5th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 5th house for Taurus Ascendant reduces attachment to recognition, romance, and speculative excitement. Creative expression becomes inward and purpose-driven rather than performative. Emotional detachment may affect love dynamics, creating periods of silence or misunderstanding. Interest in speculation declines, while intuitive intelligence sharpens quietly. Matters related to children require patience and non-projection. This transit refines intellect by dissolving ego-driven creativity. When integrated consciously, Ketu supports inner wisdom, intuitive insight, and mature emotional restraint.",
