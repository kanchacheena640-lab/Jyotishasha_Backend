  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 9th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 9th house for Taurus Ascendant triggers detachment from rigid belief systems, traditional authority, and inherited philosophies. Faith becomes experiential rather than doctrinal, often creating distance from mentors or father figures. Long-distance travel may lose appeal unless spiritually motivated. Moral certainty dissolves, replaced by inquiry and inner alignment. This transit exposes gaps between belief and lived truth. When approached consciously, Ketu refines wisdom, encourages independent understanding, and aligns dharma with personal realization rather than external validation.",
