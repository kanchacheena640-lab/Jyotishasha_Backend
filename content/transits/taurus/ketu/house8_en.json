  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 8th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 8th house for Taurus Ascendant intensifies themes of detachment, transformation, and hidden karmic processes. Sudden shifts may occur internally rather than externally, reducing fear of loss while increasing curiosity toward the unknown. Interest in shared resources, inheritances, or joint finances declines, creating emotional neutrality. Psychological insight deepens, and past karmic patterns surface for resolution. Health sensitivity requires mindful observation. When approached consciously, this transit supports profound inner transformation, intuitive depth, and release from fear-driven attachments.",
