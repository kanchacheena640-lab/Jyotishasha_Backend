  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 2nd House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 2nd house for Taurus Ascendant brings detachment from material security, speech, and established value systems. Interest in wealth accumulation weakens, while minimalism and non-attachment grow stronger. Financial flow may feel irregular, not due to loss but due to disengagement from aggressive pursuit. Speech becomes restrained, factual, or withdrawn, sometimes creating distance in family interactions. When approached consciously, this transit refines values, purifies motives around money, and redirects focus toward inner worth rather than external possession.",
