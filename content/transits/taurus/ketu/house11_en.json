  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 11th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 11th house for Taurus Ascendant reduces attachment to gains, social circles, and long-term ambitions. Desire for recognition from networks weakens, and friendships may feel selective or distant. Financial gains can become irregular, not due to loss but lack of pursuit. Aspirations are reassessed, shifting from quantity to meaning. This transit dissolves dependency on collective validation and refines goals. When approached consciously, Ketu supports freedom from expectation, selective associations, and fulfillment rooted in inner alignment rather than external achievement.",
