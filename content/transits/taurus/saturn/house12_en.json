  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 12th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Saturn transiting the 12th house for Taurus Ascendant initiates a phase of withdrawal, karmic closure, and disciplined introspection. Expenses increase toward responsibilities, health, or long-term obligations, demanding strict financial control. This transit encourages isolation for inner restructuring, spiritual discipline, and release of outdated patterns. Sleep, mental peace, and hidden anxieties require conscious management. Though progress feels invisible, Saturn works silently to complete cycles and prepare the psyche for renewal. With discipline and acceptance, this period strengthens inner stability and long-term resilience.",
