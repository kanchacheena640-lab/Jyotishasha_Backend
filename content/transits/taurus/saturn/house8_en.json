  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 8th House for Taurus Ascendant",
  "summary": "Saturn transiting the 8th house for Taurus Ascendant initiates a deep karmic phase centered on transformation, hidden matters, and long-term vulnerabilities. This transit brings slow but profound changes through delays, emotional pressure, and confrontations with fears. Matters related to joint finances, inheritance, health sensitivities, and psychological patterns demand patience and responsibility. Sudden events feel restrictive rather than dramatic, forcing inner restructuring. Though uncomfortable, this period strengthens resilience, emotional maturity, and the ability to endure uncertainty with discipline and realism.",
