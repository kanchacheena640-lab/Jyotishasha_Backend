  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 10th house for Scorpio Ascendant, career, authority, and public responsibility intensify. This phase demands discipline, accountability, and sustained effort in professional life. Recognition comes slowly, earned through consistency rather than shortcuts. Relationships with seniors and institutions test patience but strengthen credibility. Pressure can be high, yet it forges leadership maturity. By committing to ethical work and long-term goals, this transit builds a solid reputation, durable success, and respect rooted in reliability.",
