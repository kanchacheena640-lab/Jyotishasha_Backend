  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 12th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 12th house for Scorpio Ascendant, themes of withdrawal, expenditure, and inner restructuring dominate. This phase pushes you toward solitude, disciplined letting-go, and responsible handling of losses or expenses. Sleep, mental health, and subconscious fears need structured care. Work behind the scenes, foreign connections, or spiritual discipline can bring slow but meaningful progress. Avoid escapism or isolation driven by fear. Used consciously, this transit builds inner maturity, emotional boundaries, and long-term spiritual resilience.",
