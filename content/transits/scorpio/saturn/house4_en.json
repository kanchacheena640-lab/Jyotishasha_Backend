  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 4th house for Scorpio Ascendant, home, emotional security, and inner stability undergo serious restructuring. This phase can bring added responsibilities related to family, property, or the mother, demanding patience and maturity. Emotional comfort may feel restricted, pushing you to build inner strength rather than depend on external reassurance. Real estate or domestic matters progress slowly but steadily. By accepting responsibility and creating structure at home, this transit lays a strong foundation for lasting emotional resilience.",
