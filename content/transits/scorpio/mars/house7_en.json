  "summary": "When Mars transits the 7th house for Scorpio Ascendant, partnerships, marriage, and one-to-one dealings become intense and confrontational. Assertiveness rises in relationships, increasing passion but also the risk of conflict. There is a strong urge to dominate negotiations or prove strength through opposition. Business partnerships can become competitive. When Mars energy is handled with maturity, this transit supports decisive alliances, courageous negotiations, and passionate commitment without letting aggression damage long-term bonds.",
