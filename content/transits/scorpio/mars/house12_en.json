  "title": "Mars Transit in the 12th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 12th house for Scorpio Ascendant, energy turns inward, activating isolation, expenses, foreign matters, and subconscious drives. Restlessness may increase, along with hidden anger or impulsive actions taken in private. Expenses can rise due to haste or unresolved pressures. Sleep and mental peace may be disturbed if energy is suppressed. When directed consciously, this transit supports disciplined solitude, strategic work behind the scenes, foreign connections, and deep inner release through controlled action.",
