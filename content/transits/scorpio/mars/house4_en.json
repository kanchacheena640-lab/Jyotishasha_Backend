  "summary": "When Mars transits the 4th house for Scorpio Ascendant, energy turns toward home, property, and emotional security. Restlessness may rise in domestic life, creating impatience or conflicts within the household. There is a strong urge to assert control over personal space, property matters, or family decisions. Inner peace can feel disturbed if anger is suppressed. When Mars is directed constructively, this transit supports decisive action in property issues, protection of family interests, and building inner strength through disciplined emotional control.",
