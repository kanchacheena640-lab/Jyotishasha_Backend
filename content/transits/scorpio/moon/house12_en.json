  "title": "Moon Transit in the 12th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 12th house for Scorpio Ascendant, emotions withdraw inward, increasing sensitivity, isolation, and subconscious activity. There is a strong need for rest, privacy, and emotional release away from public attention. Mood fluctuations may arise due to hidden worries, sleep disturbances, or emotional exhaustion. Expenses driven by emotional needs can increase. When this transit is used consciously, it supports deep emotional cleansing, spiritual reflection, healing of subconscious patterns, and preparation for a new emotional cycle.",
