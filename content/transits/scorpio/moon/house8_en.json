  "title": "Moon Transit in the 8th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 8th house for Scorpio Ascendant, emotions turn inward and intensify around change, uncertainty, and hidden matters. Mood fluctuations may arise due to fear of loss, lack of control, or unresolved emotional patterns. Sensitivity increases toward shared finances, trust, and emotional bonds. This is a psychologically deep phase that can feel heavy, yet it offers powerful insight. When emotions are processed consciously, this transit supports emotional healing, intuitive depth, and inner transformation.",
