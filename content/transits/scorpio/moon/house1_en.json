  "title": "Moon Transit in the 1st House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 1st house for Scorpio Ascendant, emotions, instincts, and personal responses become highly visible. Mood fluctuations directly influence behavior, decisions, and how others perceive you. Sensitivity increases, making you more reactive to surroundings and people. This is a period of strong intuition but unstable emotional expression. If emotions are handled consciously, this transit helps you realign your inner needs, improve self-awareness, and respond to situations with emotional intelligence rather than impulse.",
