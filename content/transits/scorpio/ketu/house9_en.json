  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 9th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 9th house for Scorpio Ascendant, detachment reshapes belief systems, faith, and higher learning. This phase weakens blind adherence to tradition and encourages personal realization over doctrine. Guidance from mentors may feel distant or inconsistent, pushing you to rely on inner wisdom. Interest in philosophy, spirituality, and past-life themes deepens quietly. While direction can feel unclear at times, conscious reflection brings mature insight, humility, and a belief system rooted in direct experience.",
