  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 12th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 12th house for Scorpio Ascendant, detachment deepens around isolation, losses, and the subconscious. This phase enhances spiritual withdrawal, inner healing, and release of past karmic baggage. Interest in meditation, solitude, foreign lands, or secluded work increases. Expenses may feel indifferent or unnoticed, requiring mindful tracking. Emotional release happens quietly, reducing fear of loss. When embraced consciously, this transit supports profound inner peace, spiritual maturity, and liberation through surrender rather than control.",
