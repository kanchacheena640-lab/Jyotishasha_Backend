  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 5th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 5th house for Scorpio Ascendant, detachment develops around creativity, romance, intellect, and recognition. This phase reduces emotional involvement in love affairs and shifts focus away from external appreciation of talent. Learning becomes intuitive rather than structured, and speculative urges decline. Matters related to children require patience and emotional presence. When handled consciously, this transit sharpens intuitive intelligence, supports spiritual creativity, and brings clarity by releasing ego-driven expression.",
