  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 6th house for Scorpio Ascendant, detachment develops toward conflicts, competition, and routine struggles. You may lose interest in power battles and daily disputes, preferring quiet efficiency over confrontation. Health matters require awareness, as symptoms can be subtle or ignored. Service-oriented work suits this phase, especially roles involving healing or problem resolution without recognition. When approached consciously, this transit dissolves unnecessary stress, refines discipline, and strengthens inner resilience through non-reactive action.",
