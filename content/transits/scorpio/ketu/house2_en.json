  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 2nd House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 2nd house for Scorpio Ascendant, detachment develops around wealth, speech, and family values. This phase reduces emotional attachment to money and material security, creating a minimalist mindset. Speech may become blunt, quiet, or unusually factual, sometimes causing misunderstandings within family circles. Financial flow can feel irregular, demanding conscious budgeting. When handled with awareness, this transit refines values, purifies speech, and builds stability through simplicity rather than accumulation.",
