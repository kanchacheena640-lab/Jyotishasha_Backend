  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 8th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 8th house for Scorpio Ascendant, deep detachment unfolds around transformation, secrecy, and shared resources. This phase heightens interest in occult knowledge, healing, and inner psychology while reducing fear of sudden change. Emotional reactions to loss, intimacy, or uncertainty become muted, creating inner distance. Joint finances require clarity, as indifference can cause oversight. When approached consciously, this transit supports deep healing, karmic release, and powerful inner regeneration beyond attachment and fear.",
