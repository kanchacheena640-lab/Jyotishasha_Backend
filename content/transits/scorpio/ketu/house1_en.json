  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 1st House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 1st house for Scorpio Ascendant, identity, self-image, and direction undergo detachment and inner realignment. This phase reduces attachment to ego, appearance, and external validation, pushing focus toward inner clarity. Motivation may feel inconsistent, and others may find you reserved or distant. Health sensitivity requires mindful routines. When embraced consciously, this transit supports spiritual maturity, self-awareness, and authentic confidence rooted in purpose rather than projection.",
