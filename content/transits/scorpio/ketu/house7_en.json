  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 7th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 7th house for Scorpio Ascendant, detachment influences partnerships, marriage, and public interactions. This phase reduces emotional dependence on relationships and weakens the urge to seek validation through others. Partnerships may feel distant, karmic, or purpose-driven rather than romantic. Business alliances require clarity, as confusion or withdrawal can arise. When handled consciously, this transit brings maturity in relationships, freedom from dependency, and the ability to engage in partnerships with balance and inner independence.",
