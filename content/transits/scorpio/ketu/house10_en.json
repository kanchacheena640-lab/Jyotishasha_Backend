  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 10th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 10th house for Scorpio Ascendant, detachment influences career ambition, authority, and public image. The urge for status, recognition, or control weakens, pushing focus toward meaningful contribution over visibility. Career direction may feel unclear, and motivation can fluctuate if driven only by external rewards. Leadership roles require inner clarity rather than dominance. When embraced consciously, this transit builds integrity, purpose-driven work, and a reputation rooted in quiet competence rather than display.",
