  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 4th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 4th house for Scorpio Ascendant, emotional security, home life, and inner comfort detach from familiar patterns. This phase reduces attachment to property, domestic routines, and emotional dependency, creating a sense of inner distance. You may feel unsettled at home or uninterested in material comfort. Mother-related matters require sensitivity. When approached consciously, this transit strengthens inner grounding, emotional self-reliance, and peace that comes from detachment rather than external stability.",
