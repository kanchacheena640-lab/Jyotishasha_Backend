  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 3rd House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 3rd house for Scorpio Ascendant, effort, communication, and initiative turn inward and selective. Motivation to compete or constantly prove courage reduces, replacing noise with precision. You may prefer working independently, communicating less but more meaningfully. Relations with siblings can feel distant or karmic. Skill development continues quietly without the need for recognition. When used consciously, this transit sharpens focus, refines abilities, and builds inner confidence through disciplined self-effort rather than outward assertion.",
