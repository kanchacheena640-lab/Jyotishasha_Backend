  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 11th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 11th house for Scorpio Ascendant, detachment shapes gains, ambitions, and social networks. This phase reduces obsession with large goals, popularity, and validation from groups. Friendships may thin out, becoming fewer but more meaningful. Financial gains can feel irregular or less motivating, shifting focus toward purpose rather than profit. When navigated consciously, this transit refines aspirations, filters opportunistic associations, and aligns success with inner fulfillment instead of external achievement.",
