  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 12th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 12th house for Scorpio Ascendant, isolation, expenses, and subconscious patterns intensify. This phase draws attention toward foreign lands, retreats, research in solitude, and behind-the-scenes activities. Sleep patterns, mental restlessness, or escapist tendencies may fluctuate, requiring conscious regulation. Expenses can rise unexpectedly, especially on travel or intangible pursuits. When guided with awareness, this transit supports spiritual inquiry, deep psychological release, and success in secluded or global environments.",
