  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 9th house for Scorpio Ascendant, belief systems, higher learning, and life direction undergo unconventional shifts. This phase challenges traditional faith, pushing you to question doctrines and seek personal truth through experience. Foreign travel, cross-cultural exposure, or alternative philosophies gain attraction. Guidance from mentors may feel inconsistent, requiring independent judgment. While confusion can arise if direction is unclear, conscious exploration brings expanded perspective, adaptive wisdom, and a redefined sense of purpose rooted in lived understanding.",
