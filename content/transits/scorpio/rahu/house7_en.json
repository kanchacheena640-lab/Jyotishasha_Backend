  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 7th house for Scorpio Ascendant, partnerships, marriage, and public dealings become intense and unconventional. This phase attracts unusual people, foreign connections, or non-traditional alliances. Desire for validation through relationships increases, which can blur boundaries or expectations. Business partnerships may grow rapidly but need transparency to last. Power dynamics and misunderstandings can surface if motives are unclear.
