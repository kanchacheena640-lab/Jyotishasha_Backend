This phase boosts bold expression, experimentation in skills, and a strong urge to assert ideas. Writing, media, marketing, and tech-related pursuits gain momentum. However, impulsive speech, rivalry with siblings, or risky decisions can create friction. Channeling curiosity into disciplined action brings breakthroughs. Used wisely, this transit enhances influence, adaptability, and the confidence to pursue independent paths.",
