  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 1st house for Scorpio Ascendant, identity, appearance, and personal direction undergo sudden shifts. This phase amplifies ambition, visibility, and the urge to redefine oneself. Confidence can surge, but restlessness and impulsive choices may distort self-image. Others notice you more, increasing influence and scrutiny. Grounding decisions in self-awareness is essential. Used wisely, this transit fuels bold reinvention and leadership; unchecked, it can create confusion and inconsistency in purpose.",
