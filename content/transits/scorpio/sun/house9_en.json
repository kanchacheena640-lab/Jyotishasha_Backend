  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 9th house for Scorpio Ascendant, focus turns toward beliefs, higher knowledge, ethics, and long-term direction. This phase strengthens the urge to define personal truth and assert authority in matters of philosophy, law, or guidance. Support from mentors or father figures may rise, though ego differences are possible. Travel linked to purpose or learning can emerge. When pride is balanced with openness, this transit supports clarity of vision, moral confidence, and purposeful expansion.",
