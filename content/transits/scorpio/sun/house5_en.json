  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 5th house for Scorpio Ascendant, creativity, intelligence, self-expression, and authority over personal pursuits become prominent. This phase boosts confidence in talents, decision-making, and leadership in creative or speculative areas. Recognition can come through education, children, or performance-based roles. However, ego attachment to success may distort judgment in romance or investments.
