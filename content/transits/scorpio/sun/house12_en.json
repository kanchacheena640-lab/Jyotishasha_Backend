  "title": "Sun Transit in the 12th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 12th house for Scorpio Ascendant, focus shifts inward toward introspection, closure, isolation, and behind-the-scenes responsibilities. This phase highlights expenses, foreign connections, and work done away from public visibility. Energy may feel withdrawn, yet awareness of inner motives deepens. Ego can feel challenged due to lack of recognition, but this transit supports spiritual discipline and strategic planning. When pride is released, the period becomes powerful for rest, healing, and preparing for a new personal cycle.",
