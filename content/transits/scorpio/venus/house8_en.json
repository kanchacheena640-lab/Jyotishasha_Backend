  "summary": "When Venus transits the 8th house for Scorpio Ascendant, themes of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional depth become prominent. This period can bring sudden shifts in relationships, finances linked to partners, or hidden desires surfacing. Emotional bonds intensify, and attraction may feel magnetic rather than light. Benefits can come through joint assets, inheritance, or partner support, but emotional dependency or secrecy can create complications. Conscious transparency and emotional maturity help this transit transform vulnerabilities into strength and trust.",
