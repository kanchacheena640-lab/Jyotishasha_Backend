  "title": "Venus Transit in the 12th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Venus transits the 12th house for Scorpio Ascendant, themes of solitude, emotional release, and hidden pleasures come forward. This phase increases the desire for privacy, rest, and subtle forms of comfort. Expenses may rise on luxury, travel, or spiritual pursuits, while emotional connections may feel distant yet deep. Creative or compassionate activities done in isolation can be rewarding. Avoid escapism or secret attachments. Channeling Venus into healing, creativity, and conscious letting-go brings peace and inner renewal.",
