  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 12th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Jupiter transits the 12th house for Scorpio Ascendant, growth turns inward toward spirituality, compassion, and release from past burdens. This phase supports charity, healing, foreign connections, and inner wisdom gained through solitude. Expenses rise but often for meaningful causes such as learning, travel, or service. Faith helps navigate losses or endings with maturity. However, unchecked generosity or escapism can drain resources. When balanced, this transit brings spiritual clarity, quiet protection, and purposeful closure.",
