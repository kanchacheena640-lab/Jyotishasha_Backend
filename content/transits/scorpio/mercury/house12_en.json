  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 12th House for Scorpio Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits the 12th house for Scorpio Ascendant, thinking turns inward, reflective, and focused on closure, solitude, and behind-the-scenes matters. Mental activity increases in isolation, sleep patterns, and subconscious processing. This phase favors research, planning in private, foreign connections, and spiritual study. However, scattered thoughts or anxiety can rise if the mind lacks structure. When used consciously, this transit supports inner clarity, strategic withdrawal, and intelligent preparation away from public view.",
