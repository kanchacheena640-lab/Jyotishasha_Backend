  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 1st House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 1st house for Libra ascendant, identity, behavior, and self-projection undergo sudden amplification. There is a strong urge to redefine image, assert individuality, and seek visibility. Confidence can spike, but clarity may fluctuate, leading to impulsive choices if balance is ignored. This phase favors innovation, unconventional paths, and bold self-expression, provided decisions are grounded in awareness rather than restlessness or external validation.",
