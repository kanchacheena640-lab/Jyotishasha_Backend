  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 9th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 9th house for Libra ascendant, beliefs, higher knowledge, and long-distance matters undergo disruption and redefinition. Faith becomes unconventional, and there is a strong urge to question traditions, teachers, and established philosophies. Foreign travel, cross-cultural exposure, and alternative learning paths gain importance. While this phase can expand worldview rapidly, confusion or rebellious thinking can weaken judgment if discipline and ethics are ignored.",
