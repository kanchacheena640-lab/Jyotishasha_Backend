  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 12th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 12th house for Libra ascendant, focus turns inward toward closure, discipline in isolation, and controlled expenditure. Hidden fears, subconscious patterns, and unfinished matters surface for resolution. Expenses require strict management, and solitude becomes purposeful rather than escapist. Progress occurs through restraint, reflection, and responsibility behind the scenes. Avoid avoidance or pessimism; structured routines, spiritual discipline, and clear boundaries transform withdrawal into inner strength and long-term clarity.",
