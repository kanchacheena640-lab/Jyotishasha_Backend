  "summary": "When Venus transits the 10th house for Libra ascendant, career, reputation, and public interactions gain grace and visibility. Professional relationships improve through diplomacy, aesthetics, and people skills. Creative, design, law, media, and client-facing roles benefit most. Recognition comes through cooperation rather than force. However, comfort-seeking or over-reliance on charm can dilute authority if discipline and accountability are not maintained.",
