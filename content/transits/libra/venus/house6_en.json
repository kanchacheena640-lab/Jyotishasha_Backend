  "summary": "When Venus transits the 6th house for Libra ascendant, harmony is tested through work routines, service, and health responsibilities. Cooperation at the workplace improves, but comfort-seeking can conflict with discipline. Relationships with coworkers benefit from diplomacy, yet boundaries are essential to avoid imbalance. Health improves through balanced habits rather than indulgence. Venus here teaches refinement in daily effort, reminding that peace is sustained by structure, not avoidance of duty.",
