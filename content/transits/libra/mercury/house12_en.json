  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 12th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits the 12th house for Libra ascendant, thinking turns inward, private, and reflective. Mental energy moves toward introspection, planning behind the scenes, and processing unfinished matters. Communication becomes subtle, selective, or internal rather than outward. This phase supports research, spiritual study, isolation-based work, and foreign connections. Clarity improves when distractions reduce, but scattered thoughts or sleep disturbance may arise if mental rest is ignored.",
