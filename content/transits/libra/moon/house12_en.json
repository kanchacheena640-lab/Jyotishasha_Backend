  "title": "Moon in 12th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 12th house for Libra Ascendant, emotions turn inward, heightening sensitivity, solitude needs, and subconscious processing. Private feelings intensify, making rest, reflection, and emotional release essential. Sleep patterns and emotional boundaries may fluctuate, especially around endings or hidden matters. This phase supports meditation, healing, creative retreat, and compassionate service behind the scenes. Avoid escapism and emotional suppression. Grounded routines and mindful rest help restore balance, clarity, and quiet emotional strength.",
