  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 5th house for Libra ascendant, detachment influences creativity, romance, intellect, and speculative pursuits. Interest in applause or dramatic expression fades, while insight-driven creativity deepens. Love feels quiet, karmic, or inwardly defined. Speculation loses charm; disciplined learning and research gain value. This phase favors authentic self-expression, teaching, and inner intelligence when expectations are released and focus remains purposeful.",
