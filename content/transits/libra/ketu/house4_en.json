  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 4th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 4th house for Libra ascendant, emotional security, home comfort, and inner peace undergo detachment. There is a feeling of disconnection from domestic matters, property, or familiar environments. Comfort does not automatically bring peace, pushing the native toward inner grounding. Relocation, minimal living, or reduced attachment to property is possible. This transit favors inner healing and emotional maturity when stability is built from within.",
