  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 12th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 12th house for Libra ascendant, detachment from material life, isolation, and deep inner processing intensify. Desire for solitude, retreats, or working behind the scenes increases. Expenses may feel meaningless, pushing a shift toward minimal needs. This transit heightens spiritual sensitivity, dreams, and subconscious cleansing. Progress comes through surrender, disciplined routines, and conscious withdrawal rather than escapism or avoidance of responsibilities.",
