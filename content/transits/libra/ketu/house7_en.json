  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 7th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 7th house for Libra ascendant, detachment influences partnerships, marriage, and public dealings. Expectations from others reduce, creating emotional distance or neutrality in relationships. Business alliances may feel transactional or karmic rather than emotionally engaging. This phase tests balance between independence and commitment. Clarity improves when relationships are approached with honesty, boundaries, and purpose instead of dependency or validation.",
