  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 3rd House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 3rd house for Libra ascendant, detachment from constant effort, self-promotion, and surface-level communication increases. Courage becomes quiet and selective rather than aggressive. Interest in writing, skills, or media may feel inconsistent, yet focused work done in isolation can be highly effective. Relationships with siblings and peers can feel distant or karmic. This transit favors disciplined practice, inner confidence, and purposeful communication over noise.",
