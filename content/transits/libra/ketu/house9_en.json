  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 9th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 9th house for Libra ascendant, beliefs, guidance, and long-held philosophies undergo detachment and refinement. Blind faith weakens while experiential wisdom strengthens. Interest in formal religion may decline, yet inner ethics and truth-seeking deepen. Relations with mentors or father figures can feel distant or karmic. This phase supports spiritual inquiry, higher learning through practice, and alignment with personal truth over inherited doctrine.",
