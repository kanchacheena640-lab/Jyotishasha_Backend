  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 2nd House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 2nd house for Libra ascendant, detachment from material security, possessions, and speech patterns becomes prominent. Financial motivation may feel low, yet clarity around true values increases. Speech turns minimal, precise, or withdrawn, which can be misread by family members. This period supports simplifying finances, reducing excess, and aligning income with purpose. Stability improves when discipline replaces emotional attachment to wealth.",
