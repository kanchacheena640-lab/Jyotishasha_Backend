  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 11th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 11th house for Libra ascendant, detachment from gains, recognition, and social validation becomes strong. Goals that once felt important may lose emotional charge. Friendships turn selective and karmic, with reduced interest in large networks. Financial gains may feel unsatisfying despite material success. This transit favors redefining ambitions, serving collective causes quietly, and finding fulfillment beyond numbers, applause, or comparison.",
