  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 1st House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 1st house for Libra ascendant, self-identity, confidence, and outward expression undergo detachment and refinement. There is a natural withdrawal from excessive self-focus and social validation. Clarity comes through introspection rather than assertion. While motivation may feel low at times, this phase supports spiritual growth, authenticity, and inner balance. Progress improves when actions are aligned with purpose instead of ego or external approval.",
