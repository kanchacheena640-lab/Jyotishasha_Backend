  "title": "Sun in 4th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 4th house for Libra Ascendant, focus turns toward home, emotional security, property, and inner authority. There is a strong need to establish control and respect within the domestic environment. Matters related to home, vehicles, or real estate gain importance. Emotional expression can become authoritative, creating distance if warmth is lacking. This phase supports building a stable foundation and leadership at home, provided ego is softened and emotional needs of others are acknowledged.",
