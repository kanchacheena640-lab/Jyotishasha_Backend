  "title": "Sun in 3rd House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 3rd house for Libra Ascendant, courage, communication, and self-effort come into sharp focus. Confidence expresses through speech, writing, and decisive action. There is a strong urge to assert opinions and lead through ideas. Relationships with siblings or peers can become competitive due to ego clashes. This phase favors marketing, media, sales, and initiative-driven roles, but impatience or dominance in communication can create friction. Balanced expression converts confidence into influence.",
