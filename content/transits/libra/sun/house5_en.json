  "title": "Sun in 5th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 5th house for Libra Ascendant, creativity, confidence, and self-expression seek recognition. There is a strong desire to stand out through talent, leadership, or intellect. Romance, children, and creative pursuits gain importance, but ego can dominate emotional expression. This phase supports performance, teaching, and speculative intelligence when discipline guides enthusiasm. Overconfidence or the need for applause can reduce joy. Balanced self-expression turns visibility into lasting respect and fulfillment.",
