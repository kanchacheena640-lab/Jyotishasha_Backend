  "title": "Sun in 7th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 7th house for Libra Ascendant, partnerships, public image, and one-to-one dynamics come into focus. Authority expresses through relationships, negotiations, and visibility in dealings with others. There is a strong desire to lead or dominate partnerships, which can challenge balance if ego overrides cooperation. This phase favors business alliances, contracts, and public-facing roles when mutual respect is maintained. Conscious diplomacy converts visibility into stable alliances and long-term gains.",
