  "title": "Sun in 1st House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 1st house for Libra Ascendant, identity, confidence, and self-expression come into sharp focus. Personal authority increases, and there is a strong urge to be seen, heard, and recognized. Decision-making becomes more self-driven, sometimes reducing Libra’s natural tendency to compromise. Leadership qualities rise, but ego clashes can occur if balance is ignored. This phase favors self-branding, initiative, and clarity of direction, provided diplomacy and fairness are consciously maintained.",
