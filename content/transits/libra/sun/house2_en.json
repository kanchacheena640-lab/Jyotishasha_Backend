  "title": "Sun in 2nd House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 2nd house for Libra Ascendant, focus shifts to income, values, family pride, and the power of speech. Self-worth is closely tied to financial stability and reputation. Authority expresses through voice, opinions, and decision-making around resources. Earnings can improve via leadership or advisory roles, yet ego-driven communication may strain family ties. This phase favors disciplined budgeting, ethical earning, and mindful speech to convert authority into lasting security and respect.",
