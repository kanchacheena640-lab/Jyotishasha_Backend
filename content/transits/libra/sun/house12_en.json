  "title": "Sun in 12th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 12th house for Libra Ascendant, focus shifts toward withdrawal, inner identity, expenses, and behind-the-scenes roles. Personal authority works quietly rather than visibly, pushing ego toward introspection and release. There is a need to reassess ambitions, manage losses, and serve without recognition. This phase supports spiritual discipline, research, foreign connections, and solitude-based work. Ignoring balance may cause fatigue or isolation, while conscious detachment builds inner clarity, resilience, and long-term renewal.",
