  "title": "Sun in 8th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 8th house for Libra Ascendant, themes of transformation, control, secrecy, and shared resources intensify. Personal power is tested through sudden changes, joint finances, and emotional depth. There is a strong urge to understand hidden matters and assert authority in complex situations. Ego struggles can arise around trust or dependency. This phase favors research, strategy, and inner strength building. Maintaining transparency and humility helps convert pressure into long-term resilience and insight.",
