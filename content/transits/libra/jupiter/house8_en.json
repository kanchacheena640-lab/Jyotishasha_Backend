  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 8th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Jupiter transits the 8th house for Libra ascendant, growth occurs through transformation, deep understanding, and handling shared resources wisely. This period encourages research, healing, and confronting hidden matters with maturity. Support may come through joint finances, insurance, inheritance, or long-term arrangements. Jupiter brings protection during sudden changes, but growth is subtle rather than visible. Excess curiosity, blind trust, or moral assumptions in sensitive matters should be avoided to maintain balance.",
