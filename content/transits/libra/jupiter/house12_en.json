  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 12th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Jupiter transits the 12th house for Libra ascendant, growth shifts inward through reflection, release, and spiritual understanding. This phase emphasizes solitude, charity, foreign connections, and behind-the-scenes efforts. Expenses may increase, but they often serve meaningful purposes such as education, healing, or long-term preparation. Jupiter offers protection during isolation and foreign matters. However, unchecked generosity, escapism, or vague planning can lead to resource drain if awareness is not maintained.",
