You may feel driven to confront hidden issues, power dynamics, and matters of control, debt, or shared resources. Emotional reactions can be sharp during sudden changes, making patience essential. This phase favors research, crisis management, and deep problem-solving, but impulsive actions can create losses or conflicts.
