  "title": "Mars in 1st House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 1st house for Libra Ascendant, personal drive, assertiveness, and physical energy rise sharply. Actions become direct and decisive, but impatience and impulsive reactions can surface. The desire to lead and take initiative strengthens, though balance—Libra’s core trait—may feel challenged. This phase favors courage, competition, and self-started efforts. However, unmanaged anger or haste can strain relationships and image. Channeling energy into disciplined action helps build confidence without unnecessary conflict.",
