  "title": "Mars in 12th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 12th house for Libra Ascendant, energy turns inward, working behind the scenes and through subconscious drives. Motivation may feel hidden, expressed in isolation, foreign matters, or private struggles. Anger or frustration can build silently if not released constructively. This phase favors work in seclusion, research, hospitals, or overseas contexts. However, impulsive actions, secret conflicts, or escapist habits can drain energy. Channeling effort into disciplined routines, spiritual practice, and controlled action preserves strength and prevents losses.",
