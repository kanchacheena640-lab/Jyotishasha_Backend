  "title": "Mars in 4th House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 4th house for Libra Ascendant, energy concentrates on home, property, inner security, and emotional foundations. Domestic matters become active and demanding, increasing the urge to control surroundings or take decisive action regarding residence or assets. Emotional restlessness may surface if peace at home is disrupted. This phase favors property work, renovations, and decisive family responsibilities. However, impatience can create conflicts with family members. Calm assertion and structured effort help restore stability and inner balance.",
