  "title": "Mars in 2nd House for Libra Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 2nd house for Libra Ascendant, focus shifts toward finances, speech, values, and family responsibilities. Assertive energy influences earning capacity and spending decisions, often pushing quick financial actions. Speech becomes sharp and direct, which can strengthen authority but may trigger conflicts if unmanaged. Motivation to secure resources increases, yet impatience can cause impulsive expenses. This phase favors disciplined financial planning and controlled communication. Balancing force with diplomacy protects wealth, reputation, and family harmony.",
