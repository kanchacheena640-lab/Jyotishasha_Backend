  "title": "Moon Transit in the 8th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Moon transiting your eighth house intensifies emotional depth, vulnerability, and inner transformation. Feelings surface around trust, shared resources, and emotional security, often prompting introspection. You may become more sensitive to hidden dynamics or unspoken tensions, and moods can fluctuate unexpectedly. Emotional attachment to control or reassurance may rise. When handled consciously, this transit supports psychological insight, healing through awareness, and emotional resilience during periods of change.",
