  "title": "Moon Transit in the 6th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Moon transiting your sixth house shifts emotional focus toward routines, health, service, and problem-solving. Daily responsibilities feel more personal, and moods are influenced by work pressure or physical well-being. There is a heightened sensitivity to inefficiencies, criticism, or imbalance in habits. Emotional satisfaction comes from being useful and improving systems. When managed consciously, this transit supports emotional discipline, practical care for health, and steady progress through mindful routines.",
