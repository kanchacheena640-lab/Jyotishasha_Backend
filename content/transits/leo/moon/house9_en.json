  "title": "Moon Transit in the 9th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Moon transiting your ninth house shifts emotional focus toward beliefs, purpose, and higher understanding. Feelings seek meaning through philosophy, learning, travel, or guidance figures. Faith and optimism fluctuate with emotional states, and personal beliefs may feel more subjective than usual. There is a stronger emotional response to moral issues and life direction. When handled consciously, this transit supports intuitive wisdom, emotional faith, and alignment between inner feelings and long-term vision.",
