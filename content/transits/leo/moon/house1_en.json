  "summary": "The Moon transiting your first house heightens emotional awareness, self-expression, and sensitivity around identity. Feelings become visible on the surface, influencing how you react and present yourself. There is a stronger need for emotional validation and reassurance, and moods can shift quickly. Intuition becomes sharper, guiding personal decisions. When handled consciously, this transit supports emotional authenticity, empathetic leadership, and a deeper connection between inner feelings and outward expression.",
