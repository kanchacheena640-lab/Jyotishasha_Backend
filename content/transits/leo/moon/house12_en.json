  "title": "Moon Transit in the 12th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Moon transiting your twelfth house draws emotions inward, increasing sensitivity, introspection, and the need for emotional withdrawal. Feelings may be difficult to express openly, creating a desire for solitude, rest, or quiet reflection. Subconscious patterns, hidden fears, or emotional memories can surface. Expenses linked to isolation, healing, or distant matters may rise. When handled consciously, this transit supports emotional release, spiritual healing, and deep inner peace through acceptance rather than control.",
