  "title": "Venus Transit in the 12th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Venus transiting the twelfth house draws Leo ascendants toward introspection, privacy, and subtle pleasures. Attraction shifts from display to depth, favoring compassion, rest, and quiet connections. Expenses may rise for comfort, travel, or healing, so mindful boundaries are essential. This phase supports artistic solitude, charitable acts, and emotional release. When desire is tempered with awareness, inner peace and creative renewal quietly emerge.",
