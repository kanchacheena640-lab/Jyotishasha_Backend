  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 2nd House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the second house creates detachment from material security, possessions, and habitual speech patterns for Leo ascendants. Financial motivation may feel muted, pushing a reassessment of values rather than accumulation. Speech becomes minimal or unusually direct, sometimes misunderstood. This phase favors simplicity, mindful budgeting, and value-based choices. When practicality is maintained alongside detachment, Ketu stabilizes inner worth beyond material measures.",
