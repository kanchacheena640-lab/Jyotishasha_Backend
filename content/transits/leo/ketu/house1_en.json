  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 1st House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the first house initiates a phase of detachment from ego and identity for Leo ascendants. Confidence turns inward, prompting self-inquiry over display. Motivation may fluctuate as old self-images dissolve, yet clarity grows through simplicity. This period favors introspection, spiritual grounding, and authentic leadership without validation-seeking. When acceptance replaces resistance, Ketu refines presence into quiet authority and inner steadiness.",
