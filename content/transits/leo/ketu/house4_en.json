  "summary": "Ketu transiting the fourth house brings emotional detachment from home, comfort, and familiar environments for Leo ascendants. Inner security is questioned, prompting a search for peace beyond external stability. Domestic matters may feel distant, yet this phase supports minimalism, inner grounding, and quiet restructuring of personal space. When emotional withdrawal is balanced with responsibility, Ketu creates calm foundations rooted in inner stability rather than dependence.",
