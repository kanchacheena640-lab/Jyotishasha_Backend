  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 12th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the twelfth house intensifies detachment, solitude, and spiritual release for Leo ascendants. Interest in withdrawal, meditation, or foreign isolation increases, while material concerns fade. Sleep patterns may shift and expenses feel vague or unnoticed. This phase favors healing, closure, and letting go of unconscious fears. When grounded routines support introspection, Ketu grants deep inner peace and freedom from old karmic loops.",
