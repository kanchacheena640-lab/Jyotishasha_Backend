  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 11th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the eleventh house weakens attachment to large networks, social validation, and goal-driven gains for Leo ascendants. Desires simplify, and expectations from friends or groups reduce. Income goals may feel less motivating, yet gains arrive quietly through past efforts. This phase favors selective associations and purpose-aligned goals. When detachment is balanced with consistency, Ketu delivers stable results without emotional dependency on outcomes.",
