  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 3rd House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the third house reduces attachment to constant communication, competition, and self-promotion for Leo ascendants. Courage becomes quiet and internal rather than expressive. Interest in short travels, networking, or media may decline, while focus shifts to selective effort and meaningful skills. Sibling dynamics feel distant but less conflicted. When discipline replaces distraction, this transit refines effort into precise, effective action.",
