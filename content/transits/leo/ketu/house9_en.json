  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 9th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the ninth house reshapes belief systems, faith, and long-held philosophies for Leo ascendants. Traditional doctrines lose emotional grip, pushing a personal search for truth beyond rituals. Distance from mentors or father figures may be felt, yet inner guidance strengthens. Long journeys feel less attractive; inner exploration dominates. When humility replaces certainty, Ketu refines wisdom into lived understanding rather than inherited belief.",
