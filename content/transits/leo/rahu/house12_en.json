  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 12th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Rahu transiting the twelfth house heightens subconscious activity, hidden desires, and withdrawal tendencies for Leo ascendants. Sleep patterns, expenses, and foreign connections become prominent themes. This phase can increase escapism if boundaries are weak, yet it strongly favors spiritual exploration, research, and behind-the-scenes work. When discipline replaces avoidance, Rahu helps release old fears and prepares the mind for a quieter but powerful inner reset.",
