  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 6th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Jupiter’s transit through the sixth house activates themes of discipline, health, service, and problem-solving for Leo ascendants. This phase pushes you to grow through responsibility rather than comfort. You may face increased workload, competition, or obligations, but Jupiter ensures that sincere effort brings steady improvement. Challenges related to health, debts, or daily routines can now be managed more wisely. This is a period where inner growth happens quietly, by correcting habits, refining skills, and strengthening your ability to overcome obstacles with patience and ethics.",
