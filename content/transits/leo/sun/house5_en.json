  "title": "Sun Transit in the 5th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your fifth house highlights creativity, intelligence, self-expression, and the desire to shine through talents. Confidence in creative abilities increases, and you may seek recognition for ideas, performance, or leadership in intellectual spaces. Romantic expression becomes more self-assured, while decision-making carries pride and authority. However, ego-driven expectations can create pressure. When balanced consciously, this transit strengthens creative leadership, sharp judgment, and joyful self-expression rooted in confidence rather than validation.",
