  "title": "Sun Transit in the 11th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your eleventh house emphasizes goals, gains, networks, and influence within groups. Ambitions become future-oriented, and you feel motivated to lead within communities or professional circles. Recognition comes through associations, collaborations, and social standing. However, ego clashes within groups can arise if authority is imposed rather than earned. When approached consciously, this transit strengthens visionary leadership, steady gains, and the ability to align personal ambition with collective progress.",
