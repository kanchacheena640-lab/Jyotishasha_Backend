  "title": "Sun Transit in the 9th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your ninth house highlights belief systems, higher knowledge, purpose, and moral direction. Confidence grows through philosophy, learning, and personal truth rather than authority alone. You may feel driven to define your own principles, question inherited beliefs, and lead through wisdom. Guidance roles, teaching, or mentorship gain importance. When balanced consciously, this transit strengthens ethical leadership, clarity of vision, and alignment between personal values and long-term direction.",
