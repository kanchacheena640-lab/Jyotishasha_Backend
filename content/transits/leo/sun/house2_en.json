  "title": "Sun Transit in the 2nd House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your second house highlights self-worth, values, finances, and speech. Your identity becomes closely linked to what you own, earn, and stand for. Confidence in expressing opinions increases, and authority shows through speech. Financial decisions feel personal and pride-driven. However, rigidity around values or tone can create friction. When balanced consciously, this transit strengthens financial discipline, dignified communication, and alignment between self-respect and material stability.",
