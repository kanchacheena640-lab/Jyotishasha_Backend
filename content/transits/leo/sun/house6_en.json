  "title": "Sun Transit in the 6th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your sixth house shifts focus toward discipline, service, problem-solving, and self-improvement. You become more conscious of duties, health routines, and daily responsibilities. Confidence expresses through competence rather than display. There is a strong desire to overcome obstacles, competitors, or inefficiencies. However, ego clashes can arise in work environments if flexibility is lacking. When handled consciously, this transit strengthens resilience, leadership through service, and the ability to win challenges with consistency.",
