  "summary": "The Sun transiting your third house activates courage, communication, initiative, and self-driven effort. You feel motivated to assert ideas, take bold decisions, and lead through expression. Confidence in writing, speaking, and negotiations increases, while the desire to be heard becomes strong. Relations with siblings or close peers may revolve around dominance or leadership roles. When balanced consciously, this transit strengthens fearless communication, disciplined effort, and the ability to influence through clarity rather than force.",
