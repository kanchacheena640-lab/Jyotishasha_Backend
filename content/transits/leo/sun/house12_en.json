  "title": "Sun Transit in the 12th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your twelfth house shifts attention toward inner life, withdrawal, and subtle self-awareness. External recognition feels less important as reflection, rest, and behind-the-scenes efforts take priority. You may feel the need to step back from constant visibility and reassess motivations, authority, and ego patterns. Expenses related to isolation, healing, or distant matters can rise. When handled consciously, this transit strengthens inner authority, spiritual maturity, and clarity through solitude rather than spotlight.",
