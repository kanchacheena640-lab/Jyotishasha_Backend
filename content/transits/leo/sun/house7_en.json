  "summary": "The Sun transiting your seventh house highlights partnerships, marriage, and public dealings. Identity becomes closely tied to how you relate one-to-one, and there is a strong desire to lead or set terms within relationships. Confidence shows in negotiations and client interactions, but ego clashes can surface if equality is overlooked. When approached consciously, this transit strengthens dignified partnerships, fair leadership in alliances, and mutual respect in personal and professional bonds.",
