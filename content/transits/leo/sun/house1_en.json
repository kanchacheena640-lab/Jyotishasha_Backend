  "title": "Sun Transit in the 1st House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "The Sun transiting your first house strengthens self-awareness, confidence, and the desire to express your true identity. This phase places focus on personal authority, leadership, and how you present yourself to the world. Vitality improves, and decisions feel more self-directed. However, sensitivity to ego or image can increase if balance is lost. When handled consciously, this transit supports authentic leadership, clear self-definition, and alignment between inner purpose and outward action.",
