  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 12th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Saturn transiting the twelfth house initiates a karmic closure phase for Leo ascendants. Old burdens, subconscious fears, and unfinished responsibilities surface for resolution. Isolation or increased expenses may occur, pushing disciplined withdrawal rather than escape. This period favors structured spiritual practice, behind-the-scenes work, and compassionate service. By accepting limits and practicing detachment with responsibility, this transit dissolves past weight and prepares you for a stronger new cycle.",
