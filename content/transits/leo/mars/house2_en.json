  "title": "Mars Transit in the 2nd House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting your second house activates strong drive around finances, values, and speech. The urge to secure resources intensifies, pushing you to act decisively in money matters. Speech becomes direct and forceful, which can motivate others but may also trigger conflicts if unchecked. Spending can turn impulsive, especially to assert security or status. When guided consciously, this transit builds financial courage, sharpens value-based decisions, and channels assertive communication productively.",
