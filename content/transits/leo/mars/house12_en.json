  "title": "Mars Transit in the 12th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting your twelfth house redirects energy inward, activating hidden effort, isolation, and subconscious drives. Action happens behind the scenes, often without immediate recognition. Suppressed anger or restlessness may surface through sleep issues or mental fatigue if energy is not released constructively. Expenses related to travel, healing, or solitude can rise. When guided consciously, this transit supports disciplined withdrawal, strategic preparation, spiritual strength, and powerful inner transformation through controlled release.",
