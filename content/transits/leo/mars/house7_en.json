  "summary": "Mars transiting your seventh house intensifies dynamics in partnerships, marriage, and public dealings. Assertiveness rises in one-to-one interactions, creating a push–pull between cooperation and dominance. Attraction can spark quickly, but impatience or competitiveness may trigger conflicts if boundaries are unclear. Business negotiations become direct and outcome-oriented. When handled consciously, this transit strengthens courage in partnerships, decisive collaboration, and the ability to confront issues honestly without escalating tension.",
