  "title": "Mars Transit in the 4th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting your fourth house energizes domestic life, emotional foundations, and inner security. There is a strong urge to take charge at home, assert opinions, or initiate changes related to property and living conditions. Emotional reactions can be sharp, especially around family matters or personal comfort. Inner restlessness may rise if peace feels threatened. When directed consciously, this transit strengthens protective instincts, decisive home-related actions, and emotional resilience rooted in stability.",
