  "title": "Mars Transit in the 1st House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mars transiting your first house ignites drive, confidence, and physical vitality. You feel compelled to act decisively, assert your will, and lead from the front. Courage rises, but impatience and reactivity can surface if energy lacks direction. This is a phase of strong self-assertion, where initiative and competitive spirit peak. When channeled consciously, the transit strengthens leadership, stamina, and the ability to take bold action without unnecessary conflict.",
