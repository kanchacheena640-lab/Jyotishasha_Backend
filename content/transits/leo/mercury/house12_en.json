  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 12th House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting your twelfth house redirects mental energy inward, toward reflection, privacy, and subtle processing. Thoughts become introspective, intuitive, and less outwardly expressed. You may prefer working behind the scenes, researching quietly, or planning without disclosure. Communication reduces externally but deepens internally. When guided consciously, this transit supports strategic solitude, mental detox, spiritual insight, and preparation for a fresh cycle of expression without confusion or mental drain.",
