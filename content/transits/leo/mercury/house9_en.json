Curiosity shifts from immediate tasks to meaning, philosophy, and future direction. You feel drawn to learning, teaching, travel, or guidance from mentors. Conversations become exploratory and idea-driven rather than purely practical. When guided consciously, this transit strengthens wisdom, ethical clarity, and the ability to communicate purpose with conviction and intellectual openness.",
