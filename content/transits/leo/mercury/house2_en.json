  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 2nd House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting your second house sharpens focus on finances, values, and speech. Thoughts revolve around income planning, savings, and practical security. Communication becomes more measured, persuasive, and value-oriented, making this a favorable phase for negotiations and financial discussions. There can be frequent thinking about self-worth and material stability. When guided consciously, this transit improves money management, refines speech, and aligns decision-making with long-term values rather than short-term impulses.",
