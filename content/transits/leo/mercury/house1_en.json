  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 1st House for Leo Ascendant",
  "summary": "Mercury transiting your first house sharpens self-expression, thinking, and communication style. The mind becomes quick, curious, and outwardly expressive, making you more articulate and responsive. Identity feels closely tied to ideas, opinions, and how you present yourself. Restlessness can appear if thoughts move faster than action. When guided consciously, this transit enhances confidence through clarity, persuasive communication, and intelligent self-presentation without overthinking.",
