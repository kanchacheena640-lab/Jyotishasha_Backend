  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 12th House for Capricorn Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits the 12th house for Capricorn Ascendant, thinking turns inward, reflective, and strategic. You may prefer working quietly, planning behind the scenes, or analyzing subconscious patterns. This phase supports research, writing, spiritual study, and confidential tasks, but can also increase mental restlessness and expenses if thoughts remain scattered. Clear boundaries and structured solitude help. Progress comes by channeling Mercury’s intellect into focused preparation, allowing insight and recovery before the next outward phase begins.",
