  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 4th House for Capricorn Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits the 4th house for Capricorn Ascendant, thoughts turn inward toward home, family, emotional security, and foundational decisions. You become more analytical about domestic matters, property, and long-term stability. Conversations at home increase, and planning related to real estate, vehicles, or education is favored. However, overthinking or emotionally detached communication can disturb peace. Balance is achieved by combining practical thinking with sensitivity, allowing clear decisions without weakening emotional bonds or inner calm.",
