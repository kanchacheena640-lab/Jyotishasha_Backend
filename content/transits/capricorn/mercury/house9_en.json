  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 9th House for Capricorn Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits the 9th house for Capricorn Ascendant, thinking expands toward beliefs, higher knowledge, ethics, and long-term vision. You become more curious about philosophy, learning, travel, and guidance from mentors. Communication with teachers, advisors, or elders increases, supporting studies, writing, and strategic planning for the future. However, logical questioning of beliefs can create disagreements if expressed rigidly. Growth comes by keeping the mind open, allowing Mercury’s intellect to refine wisdom rather than challenge it unnecessarily.",
