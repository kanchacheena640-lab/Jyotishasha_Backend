  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 7th House for Capricorn Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits the 7th house for Capricorn Ascendant, communication becomes central to partnerships, negotiations, and one-to-one relationships. You seek clarity, logic, and fairness in dealings with spouses, clients, or collaborators. This phase supports contracts, discussions, and business alliances driven by reasoned dialogue. However, excessive analysis or argumentative tones can strain bonds. Progress comes by listening as much as speaking, ensuring mutual understanding so Mercury’s intellect strengthens cooperation rather than turning relationships transactional.",
