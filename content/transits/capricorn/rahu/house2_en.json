  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 2nd House: Desire for Wealth and Voice",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 2nd house for a Capricorn Ascendant, focus intensifies on wealth, speech, and self-worth. There is a strong urge to accumulate money, status symbols, and material security, often through unconventional means. Speech becomes influential but can turn manipulative if unchecked. Family values and priorities may shift. This transit rewards strategic thinking and innovation in finances, but lasting stability comes only when ethics, clarity, and disciplined saving guide decisions.",
