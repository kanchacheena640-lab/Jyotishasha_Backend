  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 5th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, desire intensifies around romance, creativity, recognition, and speculation. You feel driven to stand out, take risks, and seek validation through talent or love. Creative ideas surge, but impulsive choices in romance or investments can backfire.
