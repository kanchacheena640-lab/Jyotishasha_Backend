  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 10th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, career ambition, public image, and hunger for authority intensify sharply. You feel compelled to rise fast, gain recognition, and break conventional paths to success. Sudden opportunities can elevate status, but shortcuts or ethical compromises may create backlash. Authority figures and systems test credibility. This transit rewards innovation, strategic networking, and calculated risks, teaching that sustainable power comes from discipline, transparency, and consistent performance.",
