  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 1st house for a Capricorn Ascendant, identity, behavior, and self-image undergo sudden shifts. You feel driven to redefine yourself, take bold risks, and stand out from the crowd. Ambition intensifies, but impatience and confusion about direction can arise if grounding is lost. This transit amplifies visibility and desire for recognition. Success comes when experimentation is balanced with discipline, authenticity, and clarity of purpose.",
