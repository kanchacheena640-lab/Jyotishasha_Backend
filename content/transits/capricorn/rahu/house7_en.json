  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 7th House: Unconventional Partnerships",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 7th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, partnerships, marriage, and public dealings become intense and unconventional. You may attract unusual, foreign, or highly ambitious partners, while expectations in relationships rise sharply. Attraction can be strong but confusing if clarity is missing. Business alliances expand reach but demand clear contracts. This transit rewards strategic collaboration and openness to new models, while teaching that balance, honesty, and boundaries are essential for stability.",
