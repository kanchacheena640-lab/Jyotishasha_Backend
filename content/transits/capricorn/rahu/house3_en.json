  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 3rd house for a Capricorn Ascendant, courage, communication, and initiative surge sharply. You feel driven to act fast, take risks, and assert your ideas. Writing, media, sales, and self-promotion gain momentum, though impatience can cause missteps. Relations with siblings and peers may fluctuate due to competitiveness. This transit rewards calculated boldness, strategic messaging, and disciplined follow-through, teaching that sustained effort—not impulsive action—secures lasting success.",
