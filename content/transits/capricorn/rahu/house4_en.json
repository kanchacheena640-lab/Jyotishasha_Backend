  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 4th House: Restless Home and Shifting Roots",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 4th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, inner security, home life, and emotional grounding feel unsettled. A strong desire for change in residence, lifestyle, or property emerges, often driven by dissatisfaction with the past. Domestic peace may fluctuate, and relationships with mother figures require patience. This transit favors unconventional living setups and property experiments, but lasting comfort comes only when emotional stability is rebuilt through clarity, balance, and conscious detachment from old patterns.",
