  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 6th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, competition, conflicts, and daily challenges intensify—but so does your ability to overcome them strategically. You become highly driven to defeat rivals, solve complex problems, and gain advantage through unconventional methods. Work pressure can increase, and health routines require attention. This transit favors victory in disputes, exams, and competitive environments, provided ambition is guided by discipline and ethical awareness rather than obsession.",
