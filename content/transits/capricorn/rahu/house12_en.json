  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 12th House: Isolation, Escape, and Hidden Growth",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 12th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, themes of isolation, foreign lands, expenses, and subconscious patterns intensify. You may feel drawn toward retreat, secrecy, or unconventional spiritual paths. Foreign connections, remote work, or overseas opportunities can open, but expenses may rise sharply. Sleep and mental rest need attention. This transit favors inner exploration, research, and behind-the-scenes work, while warning against escapism, anxiety, and loss through lack of boundaries.",
