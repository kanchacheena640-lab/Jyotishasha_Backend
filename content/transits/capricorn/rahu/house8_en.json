  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 8th House: Obsession, Secrets, and Sudden Shifts",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 8th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, hidden matters, shared resources, and psychological depth intensify. You may feel drawn toward secrets, mysteries, power dynamics, and sudden transformations. Joint finances, taxes, insurance, or inheritances require sharp attention, as volatility increases. Emotional extremes can surface in intimacy, demanding honesty and restraint. This transit favors research and crisis-handling, but warns against manipulation. Stability comes by managing fear, control impulses, and financial transparency.",
