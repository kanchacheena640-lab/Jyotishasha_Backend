  "title": "Rahu Transit in the 9th House: Questioning Beliefs and New Paths",
  "summary": "When Rahu transits the 9th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, beliefs, faith, and long-term vision undergo disruption and expansion. You feel drawn toward unconventional philosophies, foreign cultures, and non-traditional learning paths. Old belief systems may feel limiting, creating confusion with mentors or authority figures. Travel, higher studies, or legal matters bring mixed results unless clarity is maintained. This transit rewards independent thinking and global exposure, while teaching that wisdom must be grounded in ethics and responsibility.",
