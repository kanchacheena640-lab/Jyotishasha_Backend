  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 5th House: Discipline in Joy and Creativity",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 5th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, joy, creativity, romance, and self-expression undergo tests of patience and responsibility. Pleasure becomes purposeful rather than impulsive. Romantic matters demand maturity and commitment, while creative talents grow through sustained practice. Children, education, or speculative activities require careful planning. This transit teaches that lasting happiness emerges when discipline supports passion and risks are taken with wisdom, not emotion.",
