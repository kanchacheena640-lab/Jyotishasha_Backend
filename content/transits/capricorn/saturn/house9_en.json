  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 9th House: Tested Beliefs and Earned Wisdom",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 9th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, beliefs, ethics, and long-term direction are tested through real-life experiences. Blind faith fades, replaced by practical wisdom earned through discipline and patience. Higher education, legal matters, travel, or guidance from mentors may progress slowly but meaningfully. This transit demands responsibility toward principles and actions alike, teaching that true faith is built on consistency, accountability, and lived truth rather than theory alone.",
