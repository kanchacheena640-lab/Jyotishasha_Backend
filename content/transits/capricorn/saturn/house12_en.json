  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 12th House: Solitude, Release, and Closure",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 12th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, isolation, expenses, and inner discipline become central themes. You are pushed to confront subconscious fears, unfinished karmic matters, and patterns of escape. Progress happens quietly through restraint, spiritual discipline, and acceptance rather than external achievement. Expenses require strict control, especially those linked to health or long-distance matters. This transit prepares you for a new cycle by teaching detachment, emotional maturity, and responsibility toward inner peace.",
