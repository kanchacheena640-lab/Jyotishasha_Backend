  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 8th House: Transformation Through Endurance",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 8th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, deep transformation unfolds through patience and resilience. Hidden fears, shared resources, and emotional dependencies come under scrutiny. Sudden gains are unlikely; instead, stability is built by restructuring debts, inheritances, and joint finances responsibly. Intimacy deepens only with trust and honesty. This transit teaches acceptance of change, disciplined handling of crises, and inner strength forged by facing uncertainty without avoidance.",
