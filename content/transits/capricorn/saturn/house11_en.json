  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 11th House: Gains Earned Through Persistence",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 11th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, gains, networks, and long-term goals are tested for realism and endurance. Progress comes slowly but proves reliable when built on discipline and ethical alliances. Friendships narrow to serious, goal-oriented connections, while superficial ties fade. This transit supports steady income growth, structured teamwork, and fulfillment of ambitions through patience. Saturn here teaches that lasting success is achieved by consistency, accountability, and choosing the right people.",
