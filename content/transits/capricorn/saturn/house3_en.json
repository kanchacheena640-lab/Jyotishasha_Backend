  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 3rd House: Courage Through Consistency",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 3rd house for a Capricorn Ascendant, communication, effort, and courage are tested and strengthened through discipline. You are pushed to rely on persistence rather than quick confidence. Sibling matters and close interactions demand responsibility and patience. Writing, skills, and self-initiated efforts improve slowly but become durable. This transit teaches that true courage is built through daily commitment, controlled speech, and steady action, not impulsive moves.",
