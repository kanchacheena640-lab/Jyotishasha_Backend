  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 10th House: Authority Built on Responsibility",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 10th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, career, status, and public responsibility intensify. Ambitions are tested through workload, accountability, and time-bound results. Recognition comes slowly, but it is solid and enduring. Authority figures demand discipline, while leadership opportunities arise for those who accept responsibility without shortcuts. This transit teaches that true success is earned through perseverance, ethical conduct, and consistent performance rather than rapid elevation.",
