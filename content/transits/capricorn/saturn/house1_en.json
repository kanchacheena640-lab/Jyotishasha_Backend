  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 1st House: Discipline Shapes Identity",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 1st house for a Capricorn Ascendant, self-identity, discipline, and responsibility intensify. You become more serious, focused, and aware of long-term consequences. Personal growth comes through patience, self-control, and sustained effort rather than quick results. This transit strengthens resilience and leadership from within, but can feel heavy if flexibility is ignored. Saturn here asks you to build confidence slowly, honor limits, and commit to steady self-improvement.",
