  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 7th House: Commitment Tested by Time",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 7th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, partnerships, marriage, and business alliances face tests of responsibility and endurance. Relationships demand maturity, honesty, and clearly defined boundaries. Superficial connections weaken, while serious bonds strengthen through patience. Business dealings move slowly but become reliable when built on structure and fairness. This transit teaches that lasting partnerships are not formed by attraction alone, but by accountability, mutual respect, and long-term commitment.",
