  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 4th House: Foundations Through Responsibility",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 4th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, home, emotional security, and inner stability demand responsibility and patience. Domestic matters may feel heavy, requiring structured solutions rather than avoidance. Relationships with mother figures or authority at home test maturity. Property, land, or long-term assets progress slowly but steadily. This transit teaches that true emotional strength is built by facing inner fears, honoring duties, and creating a stable foundation through disciplined care.",
