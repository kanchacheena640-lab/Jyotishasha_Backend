  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 2nd House: Discipline in Wealth and Speech",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 2nd house for a Capricorn Ascendant, finances, values, and speech come under strict review. Money grows slowly but steadily through discipline, patience, and responsible choices. Speech becomes measured and purposeful, favoring clarity over charm. Family responsibilities may increase, requiring maturity and restraint. This transit teaches long-term financial security by aligning income with ethics, reducing waste, and building wealth through consistent effort rather than quick gains.",
