  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 6th House: Mastery Through Discipline",
  "summary": "When Saturn transits the 6th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, daily work, health, and responsibilities demand strict discipline. Challenges increase, but so does your ability to handle pressure with maturity. Enemies, debts, or obstacles are overcome slowly through persistence rather than force. This transit strengthens endurance, work ethics, and problem-solving skills. Saturn here teaches that true victory comes from consistency, self-control, and facing difficulties without avoidance.",
