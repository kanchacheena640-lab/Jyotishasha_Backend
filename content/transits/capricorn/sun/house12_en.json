  "title": "Sun Transit in the 12th House for Capricorn Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 12th house for Capricorn Ascendant, focus shifts inward toward solitude, reflection, expenses, and letting go. This phase reduces outward visibility while strengthening inner discipline and spiritual awareness. You may feel drawn to behind-the-scenes work, foreign connections, or structured isolation for planning and recovery. Expenses can rise, especially for responsibilities that are not immediately visible. Growth comes by accepting withdrawal as preparation. When ego releases control, this transit helps restore clarity, conserve energy, and realign long-term goals quietly.",
