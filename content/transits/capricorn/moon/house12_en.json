  "title": "Moon Transit in the 12th House for Capricorn Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 12th house for Capricorn Ascendant, emotions turn inward toward solitude, release, and subconscious patterns. You may feel emotionally withdrawn, sensitive, or in need of rest and privacy. Sleep, dreams, and hidden anxieties become more prominent, while expenses can rise quietly. This phase favors emotional detox, spiritual reflection, and letting go of emotional burdens. Stability returns by accepting withdrawal as healing rather than weakness, allowing inner balance and quiet clarity to emerge.",
