  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 8th house for Capricorn Ascendant, emotions deepen and turn toward transformation, shared matters, and hidden concerns. You may feel inwardly intense, with heightened sensitivity around trust, control, and vulnerability. Sudden emotional shifts are possible, especially around joint finances or intimate bonds. This phase favors introspection and psychological insight but can feel heavy if emotions are suppressed. Stability emerges by acknowledging feelings calmly and allowing change without resistance, strengthening emotional resilience and inner maturity.",
