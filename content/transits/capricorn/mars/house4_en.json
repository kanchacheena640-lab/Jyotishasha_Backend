  "summary": "When Mars transits the 4th house for Capricorn Ascendant, energy and tension concentrate around home, family matters, property, and inner security. You may feel driven to assert control in domestic situations or make decisive moves related to real estate and living arrangements. Irritability can surface at home if emotions are suppressed.
