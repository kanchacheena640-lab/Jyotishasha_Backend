  "title": "Mars Transit in the 7th House for Capricorn Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 7th house for Capricorn Ascendant, partnerships, marriage, and one-to-one dealings become highly charged with assertive energy. You may feel compelled to dominate negotiations or push relationships toward decisive outcomes. Passion and intensity rise, but impatience can spark conflicts with partners, clients, or collaborators. This phase favors bold business alliances and clear boundary-setting when handled maturely. Balance is achieved by practicing restraint and cooperation, allowing Mars’ drive to strengthen partnerships rather than strain them.",
