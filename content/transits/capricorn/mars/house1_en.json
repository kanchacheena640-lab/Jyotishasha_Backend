  "title": "Mars Transit in the 1st House for Capricorn Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 1st house for Capricorn Ascendant, physical energy, drive, and assertiveness rise sharply. You may feel highly motivated to take initiative, push boundaries, and act decisively. Confidence increases, but impatience and anger can surface if energy is not directed constructively. This phase supports leadership, courage, and personal action, especially when goals are clear. Balance comes by combining Mars’ force with Capricorn’s discipline, allowing strength to express itself through controlled and purposeful action.",
