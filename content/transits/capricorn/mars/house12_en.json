  "title": "Mars Transit in the 12th House for Capricorn Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 12th house for Capricorn Ascendant, energy turns inward, focusing on isolation, rest, expenses, and hidden efforts. You may feel driven to work behind the scenes, confront subconscious anger, or withdraw to regain strength. Expenses can rise due to impulsive actions or health-related needs. This phase supports disciplined solitude, research, and spiritual or strategic preparation. Balance comes by controlling impulsiveness and channeling Mars’ force into quiet planning, allowing recovery and renewal before the next outward push.",
