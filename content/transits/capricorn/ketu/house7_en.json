  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 7th House: Detachment in Partnerships",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 7th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, relationships and partnerships undergo emotional distancing and reassessment. You may feel less dependent on others for validation, leading to a cooler approach in marriage or business alliances. Existing partnerships demand clarity, patience, and conscious effort to avoid misunderstandings. This transit favors independence and self-awareness, teaching that balanced relationships survive only when attachment gives way to mutual respect and clear boundaries.",
