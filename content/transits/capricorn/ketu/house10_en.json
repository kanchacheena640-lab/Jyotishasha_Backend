  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 10th House: Detachment from Status and Redefined Purpose",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 10th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, attachment to status, titles, and public recognition weakens. Career direction may feel unclear, yet a deeper need for purpose-driven work emerges. You may withdraw from politics or visibility-heavy roles, preferring meaningful contribution over applause. Authority figures feel distant, and progress appears slow unless aligned with inner values. This transit teaches that real success is measured by integrity and fulfillment, not external validation.",
