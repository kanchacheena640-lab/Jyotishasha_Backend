  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 11th House: Detachment from Gains and Social Circles",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 11th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, attachment to gains, ambitions, and social validation reduces. Goals may feel less exciting, and large networks or friendships lose their pull unless they carry meaning. Income can continue, but the urge to chase expansion weakens. You become selective about associations and redefine success on personal terms. This transit teaches that fulfillment grows when expectations drop and contributions align with inner values rather than numbers or applause.",
