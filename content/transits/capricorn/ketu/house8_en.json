  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 8th House: Deep Detachment and Inner Transformation",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 8th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, detachment deepens around control, fear, and shared resources. Sudden changes push you toward surrender and inner transformation rather than resistance. Interest grows in hidden knowledge, healing, and spiritual truths, while joint finances and inheritances demand careful awareness. Emotional intensity reduces outwardly but processes internally. This transit favors research, introspection, and karmic release, teaching that true power emerges when attachment to control dissolves.",
