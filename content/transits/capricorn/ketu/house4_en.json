  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 4th House: Detachment from Comfort and Emotional Roots",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 4th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, emotional security, home comforts, and inner peace undergo detachment. You may feel disconnected from familiar surroundings or less attached to property and domestic matters. Inner restlessness can arise despite external stability. Mother-related matters need sensitivity. This transit favors inner grounding, minimalist living, and emotional maturity, teaching that true peace is cultivated internally rather than relying on external comfort or possessions.",
