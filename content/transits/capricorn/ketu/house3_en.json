  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 3rd House: Silent Strength and Selective Action",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 3rd house for a Capricorn Ascendant, effort, communication, and initiative turn inward and selective. You may act less impulsively and speak only when necessary, preferring depth over noise. Motivation fluctuates, yet focused efforts bring precise results. Sibling dynamics may feel distant, requiring conscious warmth. This transit favors research, writing, and skill refinement done quietly, teaching that disciplined action and inner courage matter more than constant visibility.",
