  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 1st house for a Capricorn Ascendant, self-image, confidence, and personal direction undergo quiet detachment. You may feel less driven by external validation and more inwardly focused, questioning who you are beyond roles and status. Motivation can fluctuate, yet clarity grows through introspection. Health and vitality need mindful care. This transit favors spiritual grounding and authenticity, teaching that strength returns when ego relaxes and purpose aligns from within.",
