  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 2nd House: Detachment from Wealth and Speech",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 2nd house for a Capricorn Ascendant, attachment to money, possessions, and speech patterns loosens. You may feel indifferent toward material accumulation and more selective in communication. Income can fluctuate if focus drops, yet clarity grows around what truly holds value. Family dynamics require sensitivity, as emotional distance may be misunderstood. This transit favors minimalism, truthful speech, and redefining security beyond finances, teaching that stability comes from inner worth rather than possessions.",
