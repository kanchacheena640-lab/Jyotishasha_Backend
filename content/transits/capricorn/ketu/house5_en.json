  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 5th House: Detachment from Romance and Recognition",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 5th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, attachment to romance, recognition, and creative validation reduces. You may feel less driven to seek applause, love drama, or speculative excitement. Creativity turns inward and becomes more reflective. Matters related to children or education require patience and emotional presence. This transit favors learning for wisdom rather than status, teaching that joy deepens when expectations drop and expression becomes authentic.",
