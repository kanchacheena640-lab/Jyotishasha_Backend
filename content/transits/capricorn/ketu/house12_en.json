  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 12th House: Liberation through Letting Go",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 12th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, detachment deepens toward material life, expenses, and unconscious patterns. You may feel drawn to solitude, spiritual retreat, or work done quietly away from public view. Sleep cycles, dreams, and intuition become prominent, requiring disciplined rest. Expenses can rise if boundaries blur. This transit favors meditation, healing, and foreign or secluded environments, teaching that true freedom comes from conscious release, not avoidance.",
