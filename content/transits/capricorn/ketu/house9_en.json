  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 9th House: Redefining Faith and Wisdom",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 9th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, belief systems, faith, and guidance undergo detachment and reevaluation. You may feel disconnected from traditional doctrines, mentors, or inherited philosophies, seeking truth through personal experience instead. Long-distance travel, higher learning, or legal matters require patience and clarity. This transit favors inner wisdom over blind belief, teaching that true dharma emerges from lived understanding, humility, and disciplined inquiry rather than rigid ideology.",
