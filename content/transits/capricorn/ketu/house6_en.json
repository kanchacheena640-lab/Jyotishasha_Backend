  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 6th House: Quiet Mastery over Challenges",
  "summary": "When Ketu transits the 6th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, daily struggles, competition, and health matters take a detached tone. You become less reactive to conflicts and more inclined to resolve issues quietly. Enemies lose power when ignored, yet negligence toward routines can create health gaps. This transit supports service-oriented work, healing, and disciplined problem-solving. True victory comes not from confrontation, but from consistency, humility, and mindful care of the body.",
