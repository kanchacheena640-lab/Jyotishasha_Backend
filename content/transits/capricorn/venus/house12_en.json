  "title": "Venus Transit in the 12th House: Quiet Pleasure and Release",
  "summary": "When Venus transits the 12th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, desires turn inward, private, and reflective. Pleasure is found in solitude, spiritual pursuits, creativity behind the scenes, and quiet emotional release. Expenses may rise on comforts, travel, or healing, making mindful boundaries essential. Relationships feel more compassionate but less expressive. This transit supports letting go of rigid expectations, healing old emotional patterns, and discovering peace through acceptance rather than control.",
