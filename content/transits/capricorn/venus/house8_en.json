  "title": "Venus Transit in the 8th House: Deep Bonds and Shared Power",
  "summary": "When Venus transits the 8th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, relationships, finances, and emotions move into deeper territory. Attraction becomes intense, private, and transformative rather than openly expressive. Shared resources, joint finances, and hidden matters demand maturity and trust. This transit can bring gains through partnerships or inheritance, but only when transparency is maintained. Venus here teaches you to balance control with vulnerability, allowing intimacy and transformation to unfold responsibly and consciously.",
