  "summary": "As Venus transits the 7th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, partnerships and relationships move into focus with a need for balance and maturity. One-to-one connections seek fairness, loyalty, and mutual respect rather than emotional excess. Business alliances and marital matters benefit from calm dialogue and clear expectations. This transit supports harmony through responsibility, teaching that long-term relationships thrive when commitment, patience, and shared values guide decisions.",
