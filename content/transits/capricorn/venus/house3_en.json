  "summary": "As Venus transits the 3rd house for a Capricorn Ascendant, communication becomes smoother and more appealing. Your words carry charm, diplomacy, and artistic flavor, improving interactions with siblings, peers, and close networks. Creative efforts, writing, media, and short travels turn favorable when approached with discipline. This transit supports confident self-expression without arrogance. However, it asks you to balance pleasure with responsibility, ensuring that comfort does not dilute focus or consistency in daily efforts.",
