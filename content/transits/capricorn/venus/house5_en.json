  "title": "Venus Transit in the 5th House: Disciplined Creativity and Love",
  "summary": "As Venus transits the 5th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, creativity, romance, and self-expression take a more refined and purposeful form. Love becomes serious, loyal, and future-oriented rather than impulsive. Artistic talents grow through consistent effort, not sudden inspiration. Matters related to children, education, or creative projects progress steadily. This transit favors mature romance, structured creativity, and intelligent pleasures, but reminds you to enjoy the moment without over-controlling emotions or outcomes.",
