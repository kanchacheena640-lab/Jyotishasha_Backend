  "title": "Venus Transit in the 6th House: Harmony Through Discipline",
  "summary": "When Venus transits the 6th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, harmony is built through service, routine, and responsibility. Work relationships improve when diplomacy replaces rigidity, helping you manage conflicts calmly. Health and daily habits benefit from balanced self-care rather than indulgence. This transit supports resolving disputes, organizing workflows, and bringing grace into demanding environments. Venus here teaches that real comfort comes from order, fairness, and consistent effort—not avoidance of duty.",
