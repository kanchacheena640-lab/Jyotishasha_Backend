  "summary": "As Venus transits the 11th house for a Capricorn Ascendant, friendships, networks, and long-term gains become smoother and more rewarding. Support arrives through social circles, professional groups, and shared goals. Desires are fulfilled gradually through disciplined planning rather than sudden luck. This transit favors collaboration, audience growth, and benefit from female allies or creative teams. Venus here teaches that steady relationships and ethical networking lead to sustainable success and emotional satisfaction.",
