  "summary": "When Jupiter transits the 1st house for Capricorn Ascendant, personal growth, wisdom, and self-belief expand steadily. You feel a stronger urge to improve yourself, redefine direction, and act with greater moral clarity. Confidence rises through learning and experience rather than impulse. Others perceive you as more reliable and thoughtful. However, excess optimism or moral rigidity can slow practical progress. The best results come from blending Jupiter’s vision with Capricorn discipline, turning insight into measured, long-term advancement.",
