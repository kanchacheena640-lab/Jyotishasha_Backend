  "summary": "When Jupiter transits the 4th house for Capricorn Ascendant, focus shifts to emotional security, home, family harmony, and inner stability. Wisdom guides decisions related to property, education, and domestic responsibilities. Support from elders increases, and the desire to create a peaceful foundation strengthens. Growth is steady through nurturing environments rather than outward ambition. However, excess comfort-seeking or idealism about family matters can slow action. Progress comes by balancing Jupiter’s care with Capricorn’s practicality, building lasting inner and material security.",
