  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 8th House for Capricorn Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Jupiter transits the 8th house for Capricorn Ascendant, growth occurs through deep transformation, research, and inner restructuring. This phase brings insight into shared resources, hidden matters, and psychological patterns. You may gain wisdom through crises, inheritance matters, or intense learning experiences. Faith is tested and refined, not expanded easily. While support can come unexpectedly, delays are common. Progress comes by accepting change with discipline, allowing Jupiter’s insight to guide controlled transformation rather than seeking quick relief.",
