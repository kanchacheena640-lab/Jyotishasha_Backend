  "summary": "When Jupiter transits the 5th house for Capricorn Ascendant, creativity, intellect, and purposeful expression expand steadily. This phase supports learning, teaching, strategic thinking, and guidance-driven creativity rather than impulsive risk-taking. Matters related to children, education, and self-expression gain maturity and ethical direction. You may prefer structured creativity over speculation. However, excessive caution or moral rigidity can limit joy. Growth comes by blending Jupiter’s wisdom with Capricorn’s discipline, allowing inspiration to mature into meaningful, long-term outcomes.",
