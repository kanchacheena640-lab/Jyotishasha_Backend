  "summary": "When Jupiter transits the 9th house for Capricorn Ascendant, faith, higher knowledge, and long-term vision expand steadily. This phase supports education, philosophy, law, publishing, and guidance from mentors. You seek meaning through structured learning rather than blind belief. Travel for purpose or study brings growth. While optimism rises, results require patience and discipline.
