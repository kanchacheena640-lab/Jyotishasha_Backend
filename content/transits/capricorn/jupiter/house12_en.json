  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 12th House for Capricorn Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Jupiter transits the 12th house for Capricorn Ascendant, growth turns inward through reflection, detachment, and spiritual understanding. This phase supports charity, healing, research, and work done quietly behind the scenes. Expenses may rise for meaningful causes, travel, or recovery, but they carry long-term value. Faith develops through solitude rather than recognition. However, escapism or loss of direction can occur if discipline weakens. Progress comes by combining Jupiter’s compassion with Capricorn’s structure, transforming withdrawal into purposeful renewal.",
