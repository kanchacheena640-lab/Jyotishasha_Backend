  "title": "Moon Transit in the 8th House: Emotional Depth and Inner Transformation",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 8th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, emotions turn intense, private, and transformative. Hidden feelings surface, making you more introspective and sensitive to underlying energies. Trust, shared resources, and emotional security become key concerns. Mood swings may arise without clear reasons, affecting confidence. This transit encourages emotional honesty and inner cleansing, teaching that true strength emerges when fears are acknowledged and emotional resilience is consciously developed.",
