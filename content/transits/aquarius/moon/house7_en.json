  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 7th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, emotions strongly influence partnerships, relationships, and public interactions. You become more responsive to others’ moods and expectations, seeking emotional connection through one-to-one bonds. Relationship dynamics fluctuate, making sensitivity and understanding essential. Business dealings and negotiations feel personal, so balance is required. This transit teaches that harmony in partnerships grows when emotional awareness is paired with clear boundaries and mutual respect.",
