  "title": "Moon Transit in the 2nd House: Emotional Values and Financial Sensitivity",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 2nd house for an Aquarius Ascendant, emotions become closely tied to money, values, and speech. Financial decisions are influenced by mood, making stability essential. You may seek emotional security through savings, possessions, or family support. Speech turns softer yet reactive, so words should be chosen carefully. This transit favors nurturing income sources and mindful budgeting, teaching that true security grows when emotional balance supports material choices.",
