  "title": "Moon Transit in the 12th House: Emotional Release and Inner Withdrawal",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 12th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, emotions turn inward, private, and reflective. You may feel emotionally withdrawn, needing solitude, rest, or spiritual connection. Subconscious fears, memories, or unresolved feelings can surface, affecting sleep and mental peace. External motivation feels low, while inner healing becomes essential. This transit teaches that emotional clarity and renewal come through rest, surrender, and conscious detachment from external noise.",
