  "title": "Sun Transit in the 1st House: Self-Assertion and Identity Awakening",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 1st house for a Pisces Ascendant, identity, confidence, and visibility increase. You feel motivated to assert yourself, take initiative, and be noticed for who you are. Vitality improves, though sensitivity remains high, requiring balanced expression. Leadership opportunities arise when clarity replaces self-doubt. This transit teaches that strength grows when self-belief is paired with humility, compassion, and disciplined self-care.",
