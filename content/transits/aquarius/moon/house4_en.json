  "title": "Moon Transit in the 4th House: Emotional Security and Inner Comfort",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 4th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, emotions turn inward toward home, family, and inner security. You seek comfort, familiarity, and emotional reassurance from your surroundings. Domestic matters, property, or parental concerns may influence mood strongly. Productivity depends on emotional peace, making a supportive environment essential. This transit teaches that stability and clarity grow when inner comfort is nurtured, allowing you to engage with the outer world from a grounded emotional base.",
