  "title": "Moon Transit in the 6th House: Emotional Discipline and Daily Adjustments",
  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 6th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, emotions become closely tied to work routines, responsibilities, and health matters. You may feel mentally occupied with tasks, deadlines, or resolving issues, making moods fluctuate with daily efficiency. Service-oriented roles feel emotionally demanding, and stress can reflect quickly in the body. This transit teaches the importance of emotional discipline, balanced routines, and mindful self-care to maintain productivity and well-being.",
