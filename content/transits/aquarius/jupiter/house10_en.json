  "title": "Jupiter Transit in Tenth House: Authority, Reputation, and Purposeful Growth",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit in the tenth house expands career scope, public reputation, and leadership responsibility. Professional decisions become value-driven and long-term oriented. This phase supports promotions, teaching or advisory roles, management, and ethical leadership. Recognition grows through wisdom, consistency, and guidance rather than force. However, overconfidence in authority or moral preaching can create resistance. When humility balances ambition, this transit builds lasting status, respect, and meaningful professional growth.",
