  "title": "Jupiter Transit in Second House: Wealth, Values, and Speech",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit in the second house expands focus on wealth creation, values, and speech. Financial thinking becomes long-term and principle-driven, supporting savings, stable income, and value-based decisions. Communication gains warmth and authority, helping negotiations and family discussions. This phase favors knowledge-backed earnings and ethical financial planning. However, excess optimism in spending or promises can strain balance. Grounded planning and mindful speech convert growth potential into lasting security.",
