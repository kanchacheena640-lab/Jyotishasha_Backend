  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit in the third house expands courage, initiative, and the desire to learn through action. Thinking becomes optimistic and purpose-driven, encouraging communication, writing, teaching, and skill development. Efforts made during this phase carry moral intent and long-term vision. Relations with siblings and peers improve through guidance and support. Short travels and practical learning bring growth. However, overconfidence in effort can reduce consistency. Steady action aligned with values brings meaningful progress.",
