  "title": "Jupiter Transit in Fourth House: Inner Stability, Home, and Wisdom",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit in the fourth house expands emotional intelligence, inner stability, and focus on home and roots. The mind seeks peace, wisdom, and ethical grounding in domestic matters. This phase supports education, property planning, and strengthening family bonds. Guidance from elders proves valuable, and inner confidence grows quietly. However, comfort-seeking or emotional idealism can slow action. Balanced decisions rooted in values help build lasting security and mental peace.",
