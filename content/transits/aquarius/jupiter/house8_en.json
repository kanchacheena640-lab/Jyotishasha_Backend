  "title": "Jupiter Transit in Eighth House: Transformation, Insight, and Inner Strength",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit in the eighth house deepens awareness around transformation, shared resources, and inner growth. Thinking turns reflective and insightful, encouraging research, healing, and understanding life’s deeper patterns. This phase supports managing joint finances, inheritance matters, and psychological renewal. Guidance emerges through introspection rather than outward expansion. However, moral rigidity or avoidance of change can slow progress. Acceptance, patience, and wisdom help convert intense experiences into lasting inner strength.",
