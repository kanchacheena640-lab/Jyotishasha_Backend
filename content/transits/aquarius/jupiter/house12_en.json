  "title": "Jupiter Transit in Twelfth House: Detachment, Wisdom, and Spiritual Growth",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit in the twelfth house turns growth inward toward detachment, reflection, and higher wisdom. Thinking becomes compassionate and spiritually inclined, encouraging charity, introspection, and meaningful withdrawal from excess. This phase supports foreign connections, spiritual study, healing practices, and behind-the-scenes guidance. Expenses may rise for learning or service, but they carry purpose. However, escapism or blind sacrifice can weaken balance. Conscious generosity and disciplined solitude lead to inner peace and lasting clarity.",
