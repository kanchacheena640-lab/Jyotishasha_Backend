  "title": "Jupiter Transit in Fifth House: Intelligence, Creativity, and Purpose",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit in the fifth house expands intelligence, creativity, and higher understanding. Thinking becomes wise, purposeful, and future-oriented. This phase supports education, teaching, creative expression, and value-based decision-making. Matters related to children, learning, and guidance gain positivity. Strategic thinking improves in speculation and planning, though excess optimism can blur judgment. When wisdom guides creativity, this transit strengthens confidence, clarity, and meaningful self-expression.",
