  "title": "Jupiter Transit in Ninth House: Dharma, Learning, and Higher Vision",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit in the ninth house expands dharma, higher learning, and long-term vision. Thinking becomes principled, optimistic, and guided by ethics. This phase supports higher education, teaching, publishing, legal matters, and meaningful travel. Guidance from mentors strengthens belief systems, and confidence grows through purpose-driven choices. However, blind faith or moral rigidity can limit growth. When wisdom stays flexible, this transit elevates perspective and aligns actions with a larger life direction.",
