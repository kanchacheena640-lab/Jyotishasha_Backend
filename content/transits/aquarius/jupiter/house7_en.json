  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit in the seventh house expands partnerships, relationships, and one-to-one dealings through wisdom and fairness. Thinking becomes consultative and guidance-oriented, supporting marriage, business alliances, and client relationships. This phase favors ethical agreements, counseling, and long-term cooperation. Others seek your advice, increasing trust and respect. However, over-idealizing partners or expectations can create imbalance. Clear boundaries and realistic commitments help partnerships grow steadily and meaningfully.",
