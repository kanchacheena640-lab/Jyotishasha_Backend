  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Jupiter’s transit in the first house marks a phase of personal growth, confidence, and expansion of outlook. Your thinking becomes broader, optimistic, and guided by principles. This period supports self-development, leadership, learning, and moral clarity. Others perceive you as wiser and more supportive, increasing respect and influence. However, overconfidence or idealism can dilute focus. When optimism is balanced with discipline, this transit strengthens identity and sets a positive long-term direction.",
