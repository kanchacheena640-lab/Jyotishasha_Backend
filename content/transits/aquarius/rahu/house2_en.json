  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Rahu transiting the second house reshapes finances, speech, and personal values. Income opportunities arise through unconventional sources, technology, or foreign links. Ambition to accumulate wealth intensifies, but fluctuations demand careful planning. Speech becomes persuasive and influential, though exaggeration or harshness can create friction. Family dynamics may feel unsettled as priorities change. When discipline anchors ambition, Rahu here helps build new value systems and monetization paths without compromising stability or ethics.",
