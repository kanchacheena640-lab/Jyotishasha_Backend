You feel driven to speak up, experiment with ideas, and pursue unconventional learning paths. Writing, media, technology, and digital platforms gain momentum through daring initiatives. Relations with siblings and peers may become competitive or strategic, requiring clarity. Short travels increase for opportunity and exposure. While confidence rises, impulsive moves can backfire. When strategy tempers speed, Rahu here delivers rapid visibility and skill-led growth.",
