  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Rahu transiting the fourth house unsettles emotional security and domestic patterns. A strong urge to change residence, renovate, or redefine ‘home’ arises. Inner peace fluctuates, pushing you to seek comfort through unconventional choices or technology-driven living. Property matters can bring sudden opportunities alongside confusion; due diligence is essential. Family dynamics may feel unpredictable, requiring clear boundaries. When grounding practices replace impulsive moves, Rahu here helps redesign emotional foundations and modernize the sense of belonging.",
