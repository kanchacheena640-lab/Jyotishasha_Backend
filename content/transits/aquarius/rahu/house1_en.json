  "title": "Rahu Transit in First House: Identity Shift, Ambition, and Unconventional Drive",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Rahu transiting the first house brings a powerful shift in identity, self-image, and personal ambition. You feel a strong urge to stand out, redefine yourself, and move beyond familiar limits. Confidence rises, but restlessness and over-identification with image can also grow. This phase favors innovation, experimentation, and bold personal choices, especially in technology or unconventional paths. However, impulsive actions or obsession with validation can backfire. When awareness guides ambition, Rahu here fuels reinvention and rapid personal growth.",
