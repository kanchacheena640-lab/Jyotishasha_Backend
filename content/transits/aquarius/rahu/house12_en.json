  "title": "Rahu Transit in Twelfth House: Hidden Expenses, Inner Escapism, and Foreign Pull",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Rahu transiting the twelfth house heightens expenses, isolation, and attraction toward foreign lands or unseen realms. There is a strong pull toward retreat, sleep disruption, or escapist habits if boundaries are weak. Work connected to foreign institutions, research, hospitals, or behind-the-scenes roles can expand. Spiritual curiosity rises, though confusion is possible without discipline. When awareness replaces avoidance, Rahu here turns solitude into insight, foreign links into opportunity, and closure into preparation for a new personal cycle.",
