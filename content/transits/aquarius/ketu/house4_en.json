  "title": "Ketu Transit in Fourth House: Emotional Detachment, Inner Solitude, and Redefined Home",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the fourth house brings emotional distance from domestic comfort, family conditioning, and the idea of ‘home.’ You may prefer solitude or feel unsettled in familiar surroundings. Property or home matters lose emotional pull, demanding practical handling. The inner search intensifies, making this a period for meditation and emotional detox. While family may feel disconnected, inner peace grows through non-attachment. When grounding routines support detachment, Ketu here redefines security from within.",
