  "title": "Ketu Transit in Ninth House: Redefining Beliefs, Inner Faith, and Karmic Wisdom",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the ninth house questions inherited beliefs, teachers, and rigid philosophies. You may feel detached from formal religion or traditional guidance, while an inner, experiential faith develops. Long-distance travel or higher learning may feel purposeless unless it serves meaning. Relationships with mentors can shift, pushing self-reliance in wisdom. This transit favors spiritual inquiry, research, and truth beyond dogma. When belief is replaced by understanding, Ketu here brings clarity, humility, and authentic dharmic alignment.",
