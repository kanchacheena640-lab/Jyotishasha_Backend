  "title": "Ketu Transit in Eighth House: Sudden Detachment, Inner Transformation, and Karmic Release",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the eighth house activates deep karmic transformation, detachment from control, and sudden inner shifts. Interest in mysteries, psychology, and the unseen increases, while attachment to security and predictability weakens. Sudden changes may arise through finances, relationships, or emotional patterns, pushing you to let go rather than resist. This transit favors inner healing, research, and spiritual exploration. When fear is released, Ketu in the eighth house grants profound insight, resilience, and freedom from old karmic burdens.",
