  "title": "Ketu Transit in Fifth House: Detachment from Pleasure, Inner Creativity, and Non-Attached Love",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the fifth house cools the desire for applause, romance drama, and speculative thrills. Creativity turns inward—more contemplative, less performative. Romance may feel distant or selective, and expectations around pleasure reduce. Speculation loses charm; disciplined learning and research gain appeal. Children-related matters call for patience and mindful presence. When joy is redefined beyond validation, Ketu here refines intelligence, deepens wisdom, and restores clarity without emotional entanglement.",
