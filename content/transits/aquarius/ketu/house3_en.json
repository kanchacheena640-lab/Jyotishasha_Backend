  "title": "Ketu Transit in Third House: Silent Courage, Selective Communication, and Skill Withdrawal",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the third house reduces interest in constant communication, networking, and outward display of courage. You prefer meaningful action over noise, choosing selective speech and independent work. Relationships with siblings or peers may feel distant or minimal. Short travels decrease unless purpose-driven. Skills turn inward, favoring research, writing, or solitary learning. While motivation can fluctuate, inner confidence grows through self-reliance. When clarity replaces avoidance, Ketu here builds quiet strength and focused capability.",
