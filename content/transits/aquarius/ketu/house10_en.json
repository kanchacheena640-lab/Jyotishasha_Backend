  "title": "Ketu Transit in Tenth House: Detachment from Status, Redefined Ambition, and Quiet Authority",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the tenth house reduces attachment to titles, public recognition, and conventional success metrics. Career ambitions may feel unclear, pushing you to question purpose over position. You may prefer autonomy, low-visibility roles, or work aligned with meaning rather than applause. Authority dynamics shift, and interactions with bosses or institutions become neutral or distant. This transit favors integrity-driven work and service without ego. When ambition is refined into purpose, Ketu brings quiet authority and long-term clarity.",
