  "title": "Ketu Transit in Second House: Detachment from Wealth, Speech Restraint, and Value Reassessment",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the second house brings detachment from material accumulation, family conditioning, and habitual speech patterns. Interest in money may reduce, or income sources may feel less satisfying despite availability. Speech becomes minimal, precise, or inward, sometimes creating misunderstandings. Family values are questioned, leading to a personal redefinition of security. This phase supports spiritual simplicity and ethical clarity, but requires practical budgeting. When awareness balances detachment, Ketu here refines values without destabilizing material foundations.",
