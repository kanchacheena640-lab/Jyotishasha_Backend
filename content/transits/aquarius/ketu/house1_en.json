  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the first house brings detachment from ego, appearance, and fixed identity. You may feel less interested in validation and more drawn toward introspection and authenticity. Confidence can fluctuate, yet inner clarity grows as false self-images dissolve. This phase favors spiritual inquiry, minimalism, and self-observation over outward assertion. Others may find you unpredictable or distant. When grounding routines support awareness, Ketu here enables profound self-discovery and a quieter, more aligned sense of being.",
