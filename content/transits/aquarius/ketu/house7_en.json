  "title": "Ketu Transit in Seventh House: Detachment in Partnerships and Karmic Relationship Tests",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the seventh house brings detachment and karmic testing in partnerships, marriage, and public dealings. Relationships may feel distant, unclear, or lacking emotional reciprocity. You may question commitments, expectations, and the need for constant validation from others. Business partnerships require caution, as misalignment or lack of transparency can surface. This transit pushes you to redefine balance in relationships by releasing dependency and strengthening inner completeness. When handled consciously, it brings maturity, clarity, and non-attached relationship wisdom.",
