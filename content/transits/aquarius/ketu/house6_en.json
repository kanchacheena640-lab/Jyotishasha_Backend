  "title": "Ketu Transit in Sixth House: Silent Victories, Detached Service, and Karmic Cleansing",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the sixth house brings a phase of karmic cleansing linked to work, health, and conflicts. There is growing detachment from daily struggles, office politics, and competitive pressure. You may prefer quiet efficiency over recognition. Hidden enemies weaken without confrontation, and disputes resolve subtly. Health requires conscious discipline, especially stress-related or psychosomatic patterns. When service is performed without ego and routines are handled mindfully, this transit strengthens inner resilience and delivers silent but lasting victories.",
