  "title": "Ketu Transit in Twelfth House: Liberation from Attachment, Solitude, and Spiritual Closure",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the twelfth house marks a powerful phase of detachment, withdrawal, and karmic completion. Worldly desires, expenses, and social involvement naturally reduce, while inner life becomes more active. You may seek solitude, rest, or spiritual retreat, feeling disconnected from noise and excess. Sleep patterns and subconscious themes intensify, requiring mindfulness. This transit supports spiritual liberation, healing, and release of past burdens. When surrender replaces resistance, Ketu grants peace, closure, and deep inner freedom.",
