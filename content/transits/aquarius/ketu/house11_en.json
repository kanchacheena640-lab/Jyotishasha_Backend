  "title": "Ketu Transit in Eleventh House: Detachment from Gains, Selective Networks, and Inner Fulfillment",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Ketu transiting the eleventh house reduces attachment to gains, popularity, and large social circles. Goals may feel less motivating unless they align with deeper meaning. You may distance yourself from superficial friendships and networks, preferring a few purpose-driven connections. Income can be irregular, but dependency on outcomes decreases. This transit refines desires, teaching contentment beyond achievement. When ambitions are purified and associations become selective, Ketu brings inner fulfillment, clarity of intent, and freedom from constant wanting.",
