  "title": "Venus Transit in Second House: Wealth, Values, and Refined Speech",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Venus transiting the second house enhances financial awareness, refined speech, and appreciation of values. Attention shifts toward savings, family resources, and income through creative or people-oriented skills. Communication becomes pleasant and persuasive, supporting negotiations and relationship harmony within the family. This phase favors luxury, comfort, and tasteful spending, but excess indulgence can disturb balance. When aesthetics align with discipline, Venus here supports stable wealth growth and graceful self-expression.",
