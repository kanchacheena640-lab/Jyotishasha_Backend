  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Venus transiting the seventh house enhances partnerships, attraction, and relationship harmony. One-to-one interactions become smoother, affectionate, and cooperation-oriented. This phase favors marriage matters, romantic commitments, business partnerships, and client dealings. Others respond positively to your charm, increasing agreement and collaboration. However, dependency on approval or avoidance of necessary confrontations can weaken balance. When equality and clarity guide bonds, Venus here supports fulfilling relationships and mutually beneficial alliances.",
