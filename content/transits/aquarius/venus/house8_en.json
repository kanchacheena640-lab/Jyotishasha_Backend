  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Venus transiting the eighth house deepens intimacy, emotional bonding, and transformation. Attraction operates beneath the surface, intensifying trust, closeness, and shared experiences. This phase highlights joint finances, inheritances, and emotional vulnerability within relationships. Artistic or healing interests may turn inward and research-oriented. While passion and depth increase, secrecy or emotional dependency can create imbalance. When honesty and boundaries guide connections, Venus here supports meaningful transformation and balanced sharing.",
