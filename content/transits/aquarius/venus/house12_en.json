  "title": "Venus Transit in Twelfth House: Subtle Love, Detachment, and Inner Pleasure",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Venus transiting the twelfth house softens desires and turns affection inward. Love, pleasure, and creativity seek privacy, solitude, or distant connections. This phase supports compassion, charity, spiritual aesthetics, and behind-the-scenes creativity. Foreign links and quiet retreats feel soothing. Expenses may rise for comfort, art, or service, carrying emotional value. However, escapism or secret attachments can blur boundaries. When awareness guides indulgence, Venus here brings gentle healing, refined detachment, and inner contentment.",
