This phase supports higher learning, meaningful travel, spiritual aesthetics, and guidance from mentors. Relationships benefit from shared philosophies and respectful dialogue. Artistic inspiration may connect with culture, tradition, or sacred themes. However, idealizing beliefs or teachers can blur judgment.
