  "title": "Venus Transit in Tenth House: Public Image, Career Grace, and Recognition",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Venus transiting the tenth house enhances public image, professional relationships, and career visibility. Your approach at work becomes diplomatic, refined, and people-centric, helping build goodwill with seniors, clients, and authorities. This phase favors careers linked to art, design, beauty, media, hospitality, or public relations. Recognition comes through charm and cooperation rather than force. However, prioritizing popularity over responsibility can weaken results. When professionalism balances grace, Venus supports steady success and a respected reputation.",
