  "title": "Mars Transit in the 8th House: Intense Transformation and Controlled Power",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 8th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, energy turns intense, private, and transformative. You feel driven to confront hidden issues, take control of shared resources, and push through emotional or psychological barriers. Sudden reactions and power struggles can arise if impulses go unchecked. This period favors research, healing, and deep problem-solving when handled calmly. The lesson is to channel force with restraint, converting inner pressure into resilience, insight, and lasting transformation.",
