  "title": "Mars Transit in the 12th House: Hidden Effort and Strategic Withdrawal",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 12th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, energy turns inward, private, and behind the scenes. You may work hard without immediate recognition, directing effort toward research, healing, or preparation. Expenses can rise if actions are impulsive, so restraint is essential. Sleep and mental peace need attention as suppressed anger may surface. This transit teaches that disciplined solitude, conscious release of past conflicts, and strategic planning create strength for future action.",
