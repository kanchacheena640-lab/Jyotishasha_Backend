  "title": "Mars Transit in the 10th House: Ambitious Action and Public Authority",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 10th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, ambition, drive, and the urge to lead intensify. You feel compelled to act decisively in career matters and take charge of responsibilities. Visibility increases, making actions highly noticeable to others. While this supports rapid progress and leadership, impatience or dominance can create conflicts with authority. This transit teaches that disciplined action and ethical conduct convert raw ambition into lasting reputation and professional success.",
