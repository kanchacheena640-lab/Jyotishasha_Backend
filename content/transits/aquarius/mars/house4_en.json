  "title": "Mars Transit in the 4th House: Domestic Energy and Inner Restlessness",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 4th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, energy turns toward home, property, and inner emotional foundations. You may feel restless in domestic settings, with a strong urge to take control of home-related matters. Family discussions can become heated if emotions are not managed. Property decisions demand patience to avoid impulsive moves. This transit teaches that channeling assertive energy into constructive action at home creates stability instead of conflict.",
