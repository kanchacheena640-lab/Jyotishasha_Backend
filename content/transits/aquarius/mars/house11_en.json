  "title": "Mars Transit in the 11th House: Ambitious Gains and Assertive Networking",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 11th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, ambition focuses on goals, gains, and social networks. You feel driven to achieve targets quickly and assert influence within groups or organizations. Income opportunities rise through initiative, but impatience with friends or teams can cause friction. Leadership within networks becomes prominent. This transit teaches that sustained gains come from strategic collaboration, controlled assertiveness, and channeling competitive energy toward long-term objectives rather than short-term dominance.",
