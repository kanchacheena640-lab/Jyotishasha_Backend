  "summary": "When Mars transits the 6th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, energy shifts toward work, discipline, and overcoming obstacles. You feel driven to tackle challenges head-on, compete, and prove efficiency in daily tasks. This period supports resolving long-standing issues and defeating opposition through effort. However, impatience can trigger conflicts at the workplace and strain health if stress is unmanaged. The lesson is to channel aggression into structured routines, turning pressure into productivity and resilience.",
