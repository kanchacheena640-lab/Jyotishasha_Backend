  "title": "Mars Transit in the 7th House: Assertive Partnerships and Dynamic Negotiations",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 7th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, partnerships become active, intense, and outcome-driven. You approach relationships and business dealings with strong opinions and a desire to lead, which can accelerate results but also spark conflicts. Interactions feel competitive, making patience and compromise essential. Public-facing roles and negotiations demand controlled assertiveness. This transit teaches that shared success grows when decisive action is balanced with respect, diplomacy, and clear agreements.",
