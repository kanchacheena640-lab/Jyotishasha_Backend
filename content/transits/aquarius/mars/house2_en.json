  "title": "Mars Transit in the 2nd House: Assertive Speech and Financial Drive",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 2nd house for an Aquarius Ascendant, energy focuses on finances, values, and speech. You feel driven to secure resources and defend personal beliefs. Earnings can increase through initiative, but impulsive spending or conflicts over money are possible. Speech turns direct and forceful, requiring restraint to avoid disputes. This transit teaches that disciplined action and measured communication strengthen financial stability and preserve harmony in family and professional settings.",
