  "title": "Mars Transit in the 3rd House: Courageous Effort and Assertive Communication",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 3rd house for an Aquarius Ascendant, courage, initiative, and self-effort intensify. You feel driven to take bold steps, express opinions strongly, and act on ideas without delay. Communication becomes sharp and persuasive, though impatience can trigger arguments with siblings or peers. Short travels and skill-based work gain momentum. This transit teaches that disciplined effort and controlled speech transform raw energy into sustained progress and productive outcomes.",
