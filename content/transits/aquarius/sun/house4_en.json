  "title": "Sun Transit in the 4th House: Authority at Home and Inner Security",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 4th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, focus turns toward home, emotional security, and inner foundations. You may feel a stronger need to lead or control domestic matters, property decisions, or family responsibilities. Pride in roots and heritage increases, yet ego clashes at home are possible if sensitivity drops. This transit supports real-estate planning and strengthening inner confidence, teaching that true authority is expressed through care, stability, and emotional presence.",
