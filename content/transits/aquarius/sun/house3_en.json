  "title": "Sun Transit in the 3rd House: Courage, Communication, and Initiative",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 3rd house for an Aquarius Ascendant, confidence in communication and personal initiative rises. You feel motivated to take bold steps, express ideas clearly, and assert your viewpoint. Siblings, teamwork, and daily interactions gain importance, though ego clashes can surface if listening drops. This transit supports writing, sales, leadership through action, and short journeys. Success comes by pairing courage with humility and consistent effort rather than force.",
