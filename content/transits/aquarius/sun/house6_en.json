  "title": "Sun Transit in the 6th House: Discipline, Duty, and Competitive Strength",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 6th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, focus shifts to discipline, daily work, and overcoming obstacles. You feel driven to prove competence through service, efficiency, and problem-solving. Competition increases, making this a strong phase to tackle rivals, exams, or pending challenges. Health and routines demand attention, as overexertion can cause burnout. This transit teaches that true strength comes from consistency, responsibility, and steady effort rather than display.",
