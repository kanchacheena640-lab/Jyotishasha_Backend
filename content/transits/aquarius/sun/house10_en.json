  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 10th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, career, authority, and public image take center stage. Ambition rises sharply, and you feel compelled to lead, take responsibility, and be visible for your work. Recognition comes through effort, but ego clashes with superiors or systems are possible if flexibility is lacking. This transit favors leadership roles, promotions, and goal execution, teaching that lasting success is built through accountability, discipline, and ethical conduct.",
