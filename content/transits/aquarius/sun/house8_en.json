  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 8th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, focus shifts to transformation, shared resources, and hidden power dynamics. This period brings intense self-awareness through challenges, pushing you to confront fears, dependencies, and control issues. Matters related to taxes, inheritances, insurance, or joint finances become prominent. Ego struggles can surface if authority is forced. The transit favors deep research and healing, teaching that true strength emerges through humility, resilience, and inner mastery.",
