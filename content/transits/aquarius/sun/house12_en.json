  "title": "Sun Transit in the 12th House: Withdrawal, Reflection, and Inner Power",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 12th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, focus shifts inward toward rest, reflection, and behind-the-scenes activity. Visibility reduces, but inner awareness and spiritual sensitivity increase. You may feel detached from outer achievements, preferring solitude or quiet work. Expenses can rise if boundaries blur, so discipline is required. This transit favors healing, research, foreign connections, and closure of old cycles, teaching that renewal begins with conscious withdrawal and self-awareness.",
