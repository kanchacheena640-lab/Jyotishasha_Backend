  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 5th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, creativity, self-expression, and confidence seek the spotlight. You feel motivated to lead through ideas, showcase talents, and take calculated risks. Romance, children, and creative pursuits gain importance, though ego-driven decisions should be avoided. This transit supports education, performance, and speculative thinking when discipline is applied. True success emerges by expressing individuality with responsibility and awareness of long-term impact.",
