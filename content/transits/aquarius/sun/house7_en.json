  "title": "Sun Transit in the 7th House: Partnerships, Power Balance, and Visibility",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 7th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, focus shifts to partnerships, contracts, and public dealings. You seek recognition through collaboration, but ego dynamics can surface in one-to-one relationships. Business alliances and negotiations gain momentum, while personal relationships require balance and respect. This transit highlights visibility through others, teaching that success in partnerships comes from shared authority, clear boundaries, and mutual acknowledgment rather than dominance.",
