  "title": "Sun Transit in the 9th House: Purpose, Belief, and Higher Direction",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 9th house for an Aquarius Ascendant, focus turns to purpose, belief systems, and higher learning. You seek clarity about direction, ethics, and long-term vision. Mentors, teachers, or father figures come into focus, though ego clashes may arise if views become rigid. Travel, education, and legal matters gain momentum. This transit teaches that leadership grows when conviction is guided by humility, openness, and respect for diverse perspectives.",
