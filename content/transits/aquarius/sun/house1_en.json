  "title": "Sun Transit in the 1st House: Identity, Confidence, and Leadership",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 1st house for an Aquarius Ascendant, self-awareness, confidence, and personal authority rise sharply. You feel seen, motivated, and ready to assert your individuality. Leadership instincts strengthen, but ego clashes are possible if flexibility drops. Health and vitality improve when routine supports energy. This transit favors personal initiatives and visibility, teaching that authentic leadership emerges when confidence is balanced with humility and awareness of others.",
