  "title": "Saturn Transit in Eighth House: Transformation, Endurance, and Deep Accountability",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Saturn transiting the eighth house brings deep transformation through responsibility, patience, and emotional endurance. Hidden fears, shared resources, and long-standing issues surface for restructuring. Joint finances, debts, taxes, or inheritances require disciplined handling and transparency. Psychological strength grows as you face vulnerability with realism. Progress may feel slow, but it is profound and lasting. When honesty and boundaries guide change, Saturn here converts pressure into resilience, maturity, and long-term stability in shared matters.",
