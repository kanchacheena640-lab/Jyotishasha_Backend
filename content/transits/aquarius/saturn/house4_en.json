  "title": "Saturn Transit in Fourth House: Inner Stability, Responsibility, and Foundations",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Saturn transiting the fourth house restructures inner security, home matters, and emotional foundations. Responsibilities related to home, property, or parents increase, demanding patience and practical solutions. Emotional expression becomes reserved, pushing you to build stability from within rather than seeking comfort externally. Property matters progress slowly but steadily with proper planning. While this phase may feel heavy or isolating, it strengthens roots and resilience. When discipline supports care, Saturn here creates lasting inner security.",
