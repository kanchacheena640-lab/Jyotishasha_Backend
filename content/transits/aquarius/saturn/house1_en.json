  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Saturn transiting the first house initiates a phase of self-discipline, responsibility, and identity restructuring. Your approach to life becomes serious, focused, and goal-oriented. This period demands patience, consistency, and accountability in personal actions and decisions. Physical vitality may feel restrained, urging better routines and self-care. Others perceive you as mature and dependable. While progress may seem slow, foundations built now are lasting. When effort replaces impatience, Saturn here shapes long-term strength and authority.",
