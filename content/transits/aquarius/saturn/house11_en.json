  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Saturn transiting the eleventh house restructures gains, friendships, and long-term goals. Income and achievements grow slowly but become reliable through discipline and sustained effort. Social circles shrink to serious, purpose-driven connections. Unrealistic desires fall away, replaced by achievable objectives. Support comes from mature allies rather than crowds. While results take time, they endure. When patience guides planning, Saturn here converts ambition into measurable progress and stable, long-term fulfillment.",
