  "title": "Saturn Transit in Twelfth House: Detachment, Inner Discipline, and Karmic Closure",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Saturn transiting the twelfth house brings isolation, introspection, and karmic closure. This phase emphasizes letting go, disciplined solitude, and responsibility toward unseen duties. Expenses rise for essentials, service, or long-term obligations, demanding careful management. Work behind the scenes, research, or service roles become prominent. Emotional withdrawal can occur, but it supports inner restructuring. When awareness replaces escapism, Saturn here strengthens spiritual discipline, resilience, and prepares the ground for a renewed personal cycle.",
