  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Saturn transiting the second house restructures finances, values, and speech. Money matters demand discipline, budgeting, and long-term planning. Income grows slowly but steadily through consistent effort and responsible choices. Speech becomes cautious and measured, favoring substance over flair. This phase tests attachments to comfort and possessions, urging maturity in handling resources. While restrictions may feel limiting, they build durable security. When patience guides decisions, Saturn here strengthens financial stability and value-based confidence.",
