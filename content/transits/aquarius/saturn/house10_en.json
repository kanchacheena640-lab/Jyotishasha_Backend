  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Saturn transiting the tenth house brings heavy responsibility, authority tests, and long-term career restructuring. Professional life demands discipline, accountability, and sustained effort. Recognition comes slowly, earned through consistency rather than shortcuts. Relations with seniors and institutions require patience and respect for hierarchy. Leadership roles may increase pressure but also credibility. While progress feels demanding, foundations laid now endure. When duty guides ambition, Saturn here builds a solid reputation, stable status, and enduring professional authority.",
