  "title": "Saturn Transit in Seventh House: Commitment, Tests in Partnerships, and Mature Alliances",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Saturn transiting the seventh house tests partnerships, commitments, and one-to-one dynamics. Relationships demand maturity, patience, and clear boundaries. Superficial bonds weaken, while serious alliances deepen through responsibility and accountability. Marriage and business partnerships progress slowly but can become stable and enduring when built on trust. Expectations must be realistic, and duties shared fairly. Though this phase may feel heavy or distant, Saturn refines cooperation. With effort and honesty, partnerships mature into reliable, long-term structures.",
