  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 1st House: Sharp Identity and Expressive Intelligence",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits the 1st house for an Aquarius Ascendant, thinking, speech, and self-expression become prominent. You present ideas confidently, communicate quickly, and seek intellectual clarity in every interaction. Curiosity rises, making this a strong phase for learning, networking, and initiating conversations. However, overthinking or speaking too fast can dilute impact. This transit favors conscious articulation—when thoughts are organized and delivery is measured, your words shape identity, influence perception, and open doors.",
