  "title": "Mercury Transit in Eighth House: Depth, Research, and Transformation",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Mercury’s transit in the eighth house deepens thinking and shifts focus toward research, hidden matters, and transformation. The mind becomes investigative, drawn to analysis of finances, joint resources, and psychological patterns. This phase supports research work, strategy, and problem-solving behind the scenes. Conversations may turn serious and confidential. However, overthinking fears or secrets can create mental pressure. When used consciously, this transit sharpens insight and supports powerful inner change.",
