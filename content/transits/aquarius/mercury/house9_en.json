  "title": "Mercury Transit in Ninth House: Learning, Beliefs, and Perspective",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Mercury’s transit in the ninth house expands thinking toward learning, beliefs, and long-term vision. The mind seeks meaning, logic, and structured knowledge. This phase supports higher education, teaching, writing, legal matters, and philosophical discussions. Communication with mentors or elders increases, and travel-related planning gains clarity. However, excessive logic in belief systems can create rigidity. When curiosity stays open, this transit helps refine wisdom through balanced reasoning and experience.",
