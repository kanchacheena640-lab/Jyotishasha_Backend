  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Mercury’s transit in the seventh house highlights partnerships, communication, and decision-making in one-to-one relationships. Thinking becomes negotiation-oriented, making this a strong phase for contracts, business deals, and client interactions. Conversations with spouse or partners increase and tend to be practical and solution-focused. This period supports clarity in commitments and professional alliances. However, excessive analysis or argumentative speech can strain relationships. Balanced dialogue helps build mutual understanding and long-term cooperation.",
