  "title": "Mercury Transit in Fourth House: Home, Mind, and Stability",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Mercury’s transit in the fourth house turns attention inward toward home, emotional security, and mental peace. Thinking becomes more reflective, practical, and solution-oriented regarding family matters, property, and long-term stability. This phase supports planning for real estate, education, and home-based work. Communication within the family improves, though overthinking domestic issues may disturb calm. Clear dialogue and balanced decisions help create a stable inner and outer environment.",
