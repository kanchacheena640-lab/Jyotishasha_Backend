  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Mercury’s transit in the sixth house sharpens analytical ability, discipline, and practical problem-solving. Focus shifts to work routines, service, health management, and resolving conflicts logically. This phase favors competitive exams, negotiations, documentation, and efficiency-driven tasks. Communication becomes precise and task-oriented, helping handle coworkers and daily challenges. However, over-criticism or mental stress can affect balance. Structured planning and mindful communication help convert effort into steady results.",
