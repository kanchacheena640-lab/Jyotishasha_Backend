  "title": "Mercury Transit in Fifth House: Intelligence, Creativity, and Expression",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Mercury’s transit in the fifth house sharpens intelligence, creativity, and expressive ability. Thinking becomes more playful yet analytical, supporting learning, teaching, content creation, and strategic thinking. This phase favors studies, speculative planning, and intellectual pursuits. Communication with children improves, and ideas gain clarity. However, over-analysis in emotional or romantic matters can reduce spontaneity. When logic and creativity are balanced, this transit supports smart decisions and confident self-expression.",
