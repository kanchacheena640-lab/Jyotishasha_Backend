  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Mercury’s transit in the third house sharpens courage, communication, and practical intelligence. This phase activates self-efforts, writing, learning, and daily interactions. You feel motivated to express ideas, take initiatives, and strengthen skills. Sibling matters and short travels gain importance. This is a productive period for marketing, media, and skill-based work. However, mental restlessness or over-communication can create distractions. Focused thinking and disciplined action lead to steady progress.",
