  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 2nd House: Financial Speech and Value-Based Thinking",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits the 2nd house for an Aquarius Ascendant, focus shifts to money, values, and speech. You think more about income, savings, and how words influence financial outcomes. Communication becomes practical and goal-oriented, supporting negotiations and planning. This transit favors budgeting, learning new skills for earnings, and refining how you speak in professional settings. However, overanalyzing finances or being overly critical in speech can create tension. Clarity and calm expression bring steady growth.",
