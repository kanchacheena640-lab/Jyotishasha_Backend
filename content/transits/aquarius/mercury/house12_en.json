  "title": "Mercury Transit in Twelfth House: Reflection, Strategy, and Closure",
  "summary": "For Aquarius Ascendant, Mercury’s transit in the twelfth house turns the mind inward toward reflection, planning, and behind-the-scenes work. Thinking becomes introspective and strategic, favoring research, documentation, and confidential discussions. This phase supports foreign connections, remote work, and mental detox. Communication is selective, with emphasis on privacy and clarity. However, excessive rumination can drain focus. When thoughts are organized and intentions clear, this transit helps release clutter and prepare for a fresh cycle.",
