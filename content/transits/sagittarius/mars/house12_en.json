  "title": "Mars Transit in the 12th House for Sagittarius Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mars transits the 12th house for Sagittarius Ascendant, energy turns inward, highlighting isolation, expenses, and hidden efforts. Motivation works behind the scenes, supporting research, foreign matters, and spiritual discipline. Unchecked anger can drain energy or increase losses, especially through impulsive actions. Sleep, recovery, and mental boundaries require care. When directed consciously, this transit favors strategic withdrawal, disciplined solitude, and effective work in confidential or overseas environments.",
