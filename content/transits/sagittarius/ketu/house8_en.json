  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 8th house for Sagittarius ascendant intensifies inner transformation, detachment from control, and interest in hidden realities. Sudden shifts around shared resources or emotional bonds can feel unsettling, yet they strip illusions. Curiosity toward psychology, healing, or occult subjects deepens. Anxiety rises if outcomes are forced. Progress comes by accepting change, practicing transparency in joint matters, and using insight for healing rather than withdrawal.",
