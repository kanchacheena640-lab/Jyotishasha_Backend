  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 12th House for Sagittarius Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 12th house for Sagittarius ascendant intensifies detachment, solitude, and inner withdrawal. Interest in isolation, spiritual practices, or foreign environments increases, while worldly attachments weaken. Sleep patterns and subconscious activity become prominent, requiring grounding. Expenses may rise quietly if awareness drops. Growth comes by practicing conscious detachment, disciplined routines, and using solitude for insight rather than escapism.",
