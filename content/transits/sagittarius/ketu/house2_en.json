  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 2nd House for Sagittarius Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 2nd house for Sagittarius ascendant creates detachment from material security, speech patterns, and inherited values. Interest in possessions reduces, while financial flows may feel irregular if clarity is missing. Speech becomes minimal or inward, favoring silence over persuasion. Family matters require sensitivity, as emotional distance can be misunderstood. Stability returns when finances are managed simply, communication stays mindful, and values are redefined beyond material attachment.",
