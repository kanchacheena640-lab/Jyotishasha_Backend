  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 3rd House for Sagittarius Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 3rd house for Sagittarius ascendant reduces attachment to constant communication, social noise, and short-term pursuits. Courage becomes quiet and inward, shifting focus from proving strength to conserving energy. Efforts feel selective; multitasking loses appeal. Relations with siblings or peers may feel distant if silence is misunderstood. Progress comes by choosing meaningful actions, refining skills patiently, and balancing inner focus with necessary interaction.",
