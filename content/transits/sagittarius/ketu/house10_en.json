  "title": "Ketu Transit in the 10th House for Sagittarius Ascendant",
  "summary": "Ketu transiting the 10th house for Sagittarius ascendant brings detachment from titles, public recognition, and conventional career ambition. Professional roles may feel purposeless unless aligned with inner values. Visibility reduces by choice, favoring behind-the-scenes contribution. Authority dynamics require clarity, as indifference can be misread. Progress comes by redefining success, committing to meaningful work, and balancing detachment with responsibility and accountability.",
