  "title": "Mercury Transit in the 12th House for Sagittarius Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Mercury transits the 12th house for Sagittarius Ascendant, the mind turns inward, reflective, and private. Thoughts focus on solitude, rest, foreign matters, and behind-the-scenes planning. Communication becomes subtle and selective, favoring writing, research, or confidential discussions. Overthinking can disturb sleep or create anxiety if boundaries are weak. When used consciously, this transit supports spiritual study, strategic withdrawal, foreign connections, and quiet preparation before major decisions.",
