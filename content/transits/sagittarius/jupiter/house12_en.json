  "title": "Jupiter Transit in the 12th House for Sagittarius Ascendant",
  "summary": "When Jupiter transits the 12th house for Sagittarius Ascendant, focus shifts toward spirituality, detachment, and inner expansion. This phase supports introspection, charitable acts, foreign connections, and behind-the-scenes growth. Expenses may rise, but often for meaningful causes such as education, travel, or healing. Solitude brings clarity and wisdom if embraced consciously. However, escapism or careless spending can weaken stability. With discipline, this transit fosters spiritual maturity, compassion, and quiet preparation for a new life cycle.",
