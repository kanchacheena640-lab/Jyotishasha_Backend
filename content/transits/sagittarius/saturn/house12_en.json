  "title": "Saturn Transit in the 12th House for Sagittarius Ascendant",
  "summary": "Saturn transiting the 12th house for Sagittarius ascendant brings a phase of closure, introspection, and disciplined withdrawal. Expenses demand strict control, especially related to isolation, travel, or obligations. This period supports spiritual discipline, behind-the-scenes work, and karmic cleanup. Feelings of isolation may arise, but they push inner maturity and detachment. Growth comes by accepting limits, managing losses responsibly, and using solitude for purposeful inner strengthening.",
