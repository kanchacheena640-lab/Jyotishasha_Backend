  "summary": "Rahu transiting the 12th house for Sagittarius ascendant heightens focus on isolation, foreign links, expenses, and the subconscious. Sleep patterns and mental peace may fluctuate as hidden anxieties surface. Foreign travel, remote work, or behind-the-scenes roles can expand unexpectedly. Expenses can rise through unclear channels if unchecked. Growth comes by practicing mindful detachment, tightening financial boundaries, and using solitude for inner clarity rather than escapism.",
