  "summary": "Rahu transiting the 4th house for Sagittarius ascendant unsettles domestic comfort, emotional security, and property matters. A strong desire to change residence, upgrade lifestyle, or break family patterns emerges. Inner restlessness can disturb peace at home if expectations are unrealistic. Property decisions may feel urgent yet confusing. Stability returns when emotional needs are acknowledged, family communication stays clear, and changes are planned pragmatically rather than impulsively.",
