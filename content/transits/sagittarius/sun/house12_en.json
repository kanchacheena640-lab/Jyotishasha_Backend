  "title": "Sun Transit in the 12th House for Sagittarius Ascendant",
  "summary": "When the Sun transits the 12th house for Sagittarius Ascendant, focus turns inward toward solitude, reflection, and closure of ongoing cycles. Visibility reduces, shifting energy from external recognition to inner clarity. Expenses may rise due to travel, health, or behind-the-scenes responsibilities. Ego confronts the need to let go of control, encouraging humility and surrender. When approached consciously, this transit supports spiritual growth, healing, and preparation for a renewed personal direction.",
