  "summary": "When the Moon transits the 12th house for Sagittarius Ascendant, emotions turn inward toward solitude, rest, and subconscious processing. Sensitivity increases, making you more receptive to hidden feelings, dreams, and unspoken concerns. Energy may feel low, and the need for withdrawal or privacy grows. Expenses can rise due to health, travel, or emotional comfort. When approached consciously, this transit supports emotional healing, spiritual reflection, and the release of past emotional baggage.",
